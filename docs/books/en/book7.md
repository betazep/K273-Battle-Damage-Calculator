Kingdom opening is coming soon and in preparation here is some basic tips to help protect you. Start getting in the habit now.

#### Shield

This is the easiest strategy.

Or:

- March to clan forts when your army is not in use.
- Keep resources on hand below your warehouse protection.
- Close inactive portals.
- Send your ingots regularly to the palace.

This is the very basic strategy which will make you less of a target. No one smart enough will attack you if they have nothing to gain. This strategy protects you and the clan capital.
