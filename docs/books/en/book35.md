#### Guardsmen lvl 4 or above
Artefacts are wearable, permanent items which can give new bonuses to or enhance the existing bonuses of your captains.

However, this comes at a considerable Might boost. As such, I would suggest you carefully select which ones you upgrade.

**/!\\ DO NOT UPGRADE OR STAR UP USELESS ARTEFACTS /!\\**

**/!\\ TOO BIG A MIGHT LEVEL WILL ACTIVELY HINDER YOUR DEVELOPMENT /!\\**

- Mythril's pickaxe: resource gathering speed
- Ifrit Lord's belt: army strength
