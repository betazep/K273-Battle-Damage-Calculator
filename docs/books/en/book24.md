Another event where you can exchange the life of your army for Valor, XP, Dragon Meat, etc. As well as climbing the ladder in any current side quest.

This event is special because you can level 3 captains in one run. Here are a few key points:

- Activate personal bonuses to increase XP and Valor.
- Aydae is the captain best used in a group march.
- Combine a fighting captain with two other captains you want to level up (Cleo + Carter/Strorr for example).
- Stack troops (your highest two level guards). Add a small amount of mercs + monsters for best effect.
- Fight, then retrain your army (don't revive with gold).
- Use your gold to invest in 30 day bonuses.
- Close portals when they are not active (open kingdom advice).
- Arrange your troop health in this order to make the damage its highest potential: guardsmen > monsters > mercs.
