<p>Another event where you can exchange the life of your army for Valor, XP, Dragon Meat, etc. As well as climbing the ladder in any current side quest.</p>
<p>This event is special because you can level 3 captains in one run. Here are a few key points:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Activate personal bonuses to increase XP and Valor.</li>
    <li>Aydae is the captain best used in a group march.</li>
    <li>Combine a fighting captain with two other captains you want to level up (Cleo + Carter/Strorr for example).</li>
    <li>Stack troops (your highest two level guards). Add a small amount of mercs + monsters for best effect.</li>
    <li>Fight, then retrain your army (don't revive with gold).</li>
    <li>Use your gold to invest in 30 day bonuses.</li>
    <li>Close portals when they are not active (open kingdom advice).</li>
    <li>Arrange your troop health in this order to make the damage its highest potential: guardsmen > monsters > mercs.</li>
</ul>
