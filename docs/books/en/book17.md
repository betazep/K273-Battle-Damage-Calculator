Use your two best tiers of troops. Use more if you wish but for this strategy just use your best two tiers of guardsmen.

Here is an example of how to arrange troops. Adjust the numbers to suit your leadership amounts.

#### Example stacking

| G1 | Count | G2 | Count |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rider | 500 | Rider | 250 |
| Spearmen | 1000 | Spearmen | 500 |
| Archer | 1000 | Archer | 500 |

**Ratio:** 1 Rider / 2 Spearmen / 2 Archers.

#### Event ratios

| Event | Rider | Spearmen | Archers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Swarm | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| Doomsday | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| Ragnarok | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| Hellforge | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| Shadow | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| Tinman | 1 | 2 | 2 |

Add monsters and mercs on top of this.
