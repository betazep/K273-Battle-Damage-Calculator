One of the best ways you can help your clanmates is by providing clan chests. They are the lifeblood of the clan, allowing all of us to keep moving forward.

To help each of us be better at it, here are a few tips:

- Only use Carter for crypts, it is his job. Dress him in the best quality Tomb Raider or Omniscience equipment you can, with Amber and the Pioneer enchantment embedded.
- Level up Carter every chance you get (Doomsday, Archane's, Tinman, Rag XP, etc). He should always be one of your highest level captains.
- It's great to occasionally test your progress by doing higher level crypts, but the priority should always be to do the highest level one march crypt you can. This is the most efficient use of tar.
- Attacking citadels provides you with rare crypt keys and a clan chest. If you are nervous about tackling these, ask for tips in clan chat.
