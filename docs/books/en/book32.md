The Great Hunt is a clan tournament where each player has a list of contracts to kill monsters on their Tournament page. Successfully killing these monsters earns tournament points for the clan.

#### Contract difficulties

- **Easy**: Two contracts, 100 points each, one for your Hero and one for a Captain.
- **Medium**: Four contracts, 200 points each, two for your Hero and two for a Captain.
- **Hard**: Four contracts, 300 points each, two for your Hero and two for a Captain.
- **Expert**: No default contracts.

The difficulty of contracts can be increased. When a contract's level increases, it is replaced with a new one of the next highest difficulty (Easy -> Medium -> Hard -> Expert).

The entire list of contracts can be refreshed three times per tournament. All outstanding contracts will be replaced with 10 new ones, and the points you earned are saved.

Expert contracts are tough to complete alone, so teamwork is essential. Clanmates can help weaken your Expert contracts by sacrificing troops.

Contracts for rare monsters can level up your hero. Keep your hero lower than your best Captain to keep Triumphal Challenges achievable, so rare Expert contracts are not recommended.

#### Great Hunt bonuses

Battles against contract monsters give a personal bonus that awards extra Valor and Experience. The effect increases as more contracts are completed.

Clan leaders can activate an additional bonus for the entire clan once per tournament. This bonus doubles the effect of the individual player bonus.
