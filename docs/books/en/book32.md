<p>The Great Hunt is a clan tournament where each player has a list of contracts to kill monsters on their Tournament page. Successfully killing these monsters earns tournament points for the clan.</p>

    <h4>Contract difficulties</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Easy</strong>: Two contracts, 100 points each, one for your Hero and one for a Captain.</li>
        <li><strong>Medium</strong>: Four contracts, 200 points each, two for your Hero and two for a Captain.</li>
        <li><strong>Hard</strong>: Four contracts, 300 points each, two for your Hero and two for a Captain.</li>
        <li><strong>Expert</strong>: No default contracts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The difficulty of contracts can be increased. When a contract's level increases, it is replaced with a new one of the next highest difficulty (Easy -> Medium -> Hard -> Expert).</p>
    <p>The entire list of contracts can be refreshed three times per tournament. All outstanding contracts will be replaced with 10 new ones, and the points you earned are saved.</p>
</div>
<p>Expert contracts are tough to complete alone, so teamwork is essential. Clanmates can help weaken your Expert contracts by sacrificing troops.</p>
<p>Contracts for rare monsters can level up your hero. Keep your hero lower than your best Captain to keep Triumphal Challenges achievable, so rare Expert contracts are not recommended.</p>
