<p>You receive five free common summons and one elite summon every 20 hours. You can get more scrolls by completing daily quests, in the Triumphal Challenge shop, as rewards in tournaments, or as part of certain purchases.</p>
<p>Instead of using these summons one by one, save them to use in conjunction with the Summon Mastery Tournament to secure fragments for the Captain of your choosing.</p>

    <h4>Summon Mastery Tournament</h4>
