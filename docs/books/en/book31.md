You can hire new Captains by collecting their fragments. The Summoning Circle is a structure in your city where you can obtain fragments for most (but not all) Captains.

You receive five free common summons and one elite summon every 20 hours. You can get more scrolls by completing daily quests, in the Triumphal Challenge shop, as rewards in tournaments, or as part of certain purchases.

Instead of using these summons one by one, save them to use in conjunction with the Summon Mastery Tournament to secure fragments for the Captain of your choosing.

#### Summon Mastery Tournament

This tournament lets you gain additional summoning scrolls and extra fragments for a specific Captain by using your common and elite summons. The more summons you complete, the more points you accumulate.

The rotation always follows the order below. Captains marked with a slash (/) are only available every other rotation.

- Aydea
- Minamoto
- Aurora / Brunhild
- Carter
- Alexander
- Farhad / Ye Ho-Sung
- Dustan
- Leonidas
- Ingrid / Bernard
- Doria
- Wu
- Stror / Lucius
