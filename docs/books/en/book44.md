#### 1. Tournament flow and objectives

1.1 The Arcanomancer Epic Squad spawns at the start of the tournament and remains for the full duration. It is a triple captain march.

1.2 For highest damage, send your best war captains (example: Aydae, Cleopatra, Ingrid). Ensure they are equipped with the best artifacts you have, such as Ifrits Belt, Fan, and Ghostflame Lantern (if you have participated in Omens before and unlocked it).

1.3 Attack the Arcanomancer and complete missions that reward Omens Essence and Omens Summon Cards.

1.4 Attacking the Arcanomancer also rewards you with Omen Sigils, which contribute to the Omens Reward Pass progression.

#### 2. Generating points for your clan and you

2.1 Omens Essence earned from attacking the Arcanomancer can be placed into the Ghostflame Chalice in the production tab.

2.2 You can only place Essence during specific times in the Dark Omens event. These are the intervals, numbered with Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, etc.).

2.3 Adding Essence to your chalice is a clan effort and must be maintained collectively.

2.4 Chalice points generation is based on the level of the chalice, also called the flame level. It ranges from level 1 to level 5.

2.5 Level 5 is the maximum and requires excess Essence to maintain. The longer you keep your flame at higher levels, the more points your clan gains.

#### 4. Production math

Each level is roughly multiplicative by a factor of 2 per level regarding point production from your chalice.

- 88.2k per minute at level 5
- 44.1k per minute at level 4
- 22k per minute at level 3

Levels 1-2 are minimal for point generation. Levels 3-5 are most relevant for Omens summons.

Even at level 5 there is a limit to the points you can generate because points are produced per minute.

Level 5: 88.2k per minute (88,200) x 60 minutes = 5,292,000.

Therefore 5,292,000 is the maximum a clan can generate at level 5 for an entire hour, unhindered (no omens summoned on your clan to reduce your chalice flame level).

#### 6. Dark Omens strategy and omens summons

6.1 Coordinate times with your clan to pour points into your chalice to increase flame level.

6.2 Watch your opponent clan activity and summon omens when they are least active to bring down their flame level. The longer the omens are present in your opponent's clan, the lower their flame level will drop until it returns to level 1.

6.3 It is pointless to summon omens on a clan if their flame level is 1. Save summons for when the flame level is greater than 1.

6.4 Ideally, summon omens on the clan immediately ahead of you in points. If you are #1, target the clan just below you (second place).

6.5 There is a limit on the number of summons (3 different levels of omens) you can have per clan per interval. Use summons wisely. This resets each interval.

6.6 Interval VII is where things get messy. If you do not have a lead that exceeds 10,584,000 over your opponents while in 1st place, there is a real chance your opponents can catch you and take the lead. However, if you can hold a lead larger than half of that (5,292,000) for 1 hour and 1 minute, you can guarantee victory.

#### 7. Omens summons and you

7.1 When you attack an omen and do not kill that specific squad, you are hit with fatigue points. Fatigue points weaken your forces after repeated attacks. (This may have been changed by game developers recently.)

7.2 Fatigue points are relative in minutes and require longer waits before they decrease.

7.3 Injured troops from attacking omens unleashed on your clan can be revived with silver.
