    <h4>Where shall I teleport?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>For larger armies you need a tile with a "food production" bonus. Armies require food. The higher your production the larger your army can be.</li>
        <li>For silver based cities, the desert is the best place.</li>
    </ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Keep your city as close to the clan "group" as possible. This will make it easier to reinforce, send caravans, and so on.</p>
