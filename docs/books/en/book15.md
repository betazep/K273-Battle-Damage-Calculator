#### City teleport

How to teleport your city:

- Find a location.
- Press on the tile you would like to teleport to.
- Select "city teleport".
- If you don't own a teleport you will have to buy it with gold coins.

#### Where shall I teleport?

- For larger armies you need a tile with a "food production" bonus. Armies require food. The higher your production the larger your army can be.
- For silver based cities, the desert is the best place.

**Important:** Keep your city as close to the clan "group" as possible. This will make it easier to reinforce, send caravans, and so on.
