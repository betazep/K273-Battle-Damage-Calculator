Here are the many ways to reduce the time it takes to build troops.

- Captain Helen increases food production and reduces training speed. One of many reasons to buy the golden pass.
- Every spot in your city should have a barrack where possible. Remove the obsolete resource buildings.
- Hero skill points can be used to reduce training speed in the guardsmen section.
- Upgrading your city barracks.
- Attach gems and enchantments to captain and hero equipment.

All these things will reduce how many speed ups you need to use and you will rely less on expensive revives.

Any area you are struggling I can guarantee there is a solution to improve it.
