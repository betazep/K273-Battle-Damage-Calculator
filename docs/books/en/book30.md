    <h4>This event comes with a warning</h4>
    <p><strong>Hero leveling:</strong> Be careful when it comes to levelling your hero. They say your hero level should be around half the level of your best captain.</p>
    <p>Levelling your hero too much too quickly can cause you to struggle with quests, missions and events and make your progress slow down.</p>
    <p>So of course level your hero but bare this in mind everyone.</p>
