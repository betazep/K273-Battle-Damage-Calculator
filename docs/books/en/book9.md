    <h4>Kingdom opening - 24th of January</h4>
    <p>It's official! We have a month to prepare as much as possible! Don't panic or worry, the game is about to become so much fun! If you are not under a bubble, here is some advice.</p>
</div>
<ul>
    <li>Hero Ayrin, get her if possible.</li>
    <li>Upgrade your warehouses as much as possible.</li>
    <li>Send your ingots regularly.</li>
    <li>Send your armies to forts when not in use.</li>
    <li>Report hostile portals to the palace to be closed.</li>
    <li>Keep your resources below warehouse protection.</li>
    <li>Reserve your resource boxes (ask the clan).</li>
    <li>Spread your resources to players.</li>
    <li>Send surplus resources to clan buildings.</li>
</ul>
<p>More updates will come!</p>
<p>Do these things and you give them no reason to attack you. No sensible player will attack with nothing to gain!</p>
