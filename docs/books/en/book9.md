#### Kingdom opening - 24th of January

It's official! We have a month to prepare as much as possible! Don't panic or worry, the game is about to become so much fun! If you are not under a bubble, here is some advice.

- Hero Ayrin, get her if possible.
- Upgrade your warehouses as much as possible.
- Send your ingots regularly.
- Send your armies to forts when not in use.
- Report hostile portals to the palace to be closed.
- Keep your resources below warehouse protection.
- Reserve your resource boxes (ask the clan).
- Spread your resources to players.
- Send surplus resources to clan buildings.

More updates will come!

Do these things and you give them no reason to attack you. No sensible player will attack with nothing to gain!
