#### Resource gathering tip
As clan territories become larger, it is sometimes difficult to tell if a resource is "wild", or on another clan territory.

- Beside the resource, try to open a portal. If you are on another clan territory, you will be warned.
- If you are not warned, either open a portal if the distance is great, or do not open one and have the troops march to the resource.
