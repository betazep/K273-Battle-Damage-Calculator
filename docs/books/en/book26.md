    <h4>Resources gathering tip</h4>
    <p>As clan territories become larger, it is sometimes difficult to tell if a resource is "wild", or on another clan territory.</p>
</div>
<ul>
    <li>Beside the resource, try to open a portal. If you are on another clan territory, you will be warned.</li>
    <li>If you are not warned, either open a portal if the distance is great, or do not open one and have the troops march to the resource.</li>
</ul>
