During this tournament, you will be able to send your Captains to Exchanges in other Kingdoms to buy mercenaries in exchange for Silver.

It is not possible to trade on the exchanges in your own Kingdom. Your city must have a Caravan building to participate. The maximum march time to an exchange is two hours unless you have Ayrin as your hero. Finding exchanges is the toughest part of the tournament. There are exchange chats where players share coordinates, but you may also have success tracing red lines on the world map as hundreds of players flock to the exchange.

Finding exchanges is the toughest part of the tournament. There are exchange chats where players share coordinates, but you may also have success tracing red lines on the world map as hundreds of players flock to the exchange.

Each Exchange is slightly different for each player, depending on your completed research. Exchanges that have sold out disappear from the Kingdom Map.

Send your fastest Captain (Tengel with the Drum artifact) to the Exchange. The silver is deducted as soon as the Captain starts the march.

The new troops are hired at the moment the Captain arrives at the exchange IF they are still available. If your purchase is successful, a notice will appear in your Journal, showing the number of Mercenaries acquired, and the Captain automatically returns to the City with the new mercenaries. If you do not make it to the exchange before it sells out, your Silver will be returned to the City when the Captain returns.
