    <h4>Spies</h4>
    <p>Did you know that you can send spies on March alone and they can travel crazy fast and unrestricted? It's like a special ability they have.</p>
</div>
<p>This makes them perfect candidates for farming Wellsprings (WS) and Dragon Mounds (DM).</p>
<p>They can also be used to make long distance attacks quickly.</p>
