#### What is game reset (reset)?

Reset is the time each day the game "resets" events. Ending old ones and starting new ones. It's also the time your quests refresh.

#### How to view reset time?

- Press on "quests" tab
- There is two countdowns
- The second countdown underneath your 6 quest rewards is the countdown until the next reset

#### Example

Your clan arranges tin-man for "Next Reset +2".

So this is the time your countdown shows with another 2 hours on top.

So if your quest menu countdown shows 15 hours 30 minutes, your Tin-man is scheduled for 17 hours and 30 minutes.

I hope this helps guys
