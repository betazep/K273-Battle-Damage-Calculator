Memorial portals are opened when a clan member passes away or suffers a tragic loss. A clan (and often the Kingdom) will open a portal around their city as a tribute. Think of it like lighting a candle at a vigil or memorial service.

It is the height of disrespect to attack a memorial portal. Doing so will make you enemy #1 of that clan, the Kingdom, their allies, and the entire IKFPA community.

To see current memorial portal locations and pay respect to those who have suffered a loss (or to register your own memorial portal location), visit the following Total Battle chats:
