- Remove equipment from heroes if you wish to save their durability as these will likely be damaged.
- Do send a minimum of two fighting captains. Amanitor is a key captain for heroics.
- Don't send more than two tiers of guardsmen.
- Don't use G1s where possible.
- Do send as many troops as your captains can carry.
- Be aware that troop losses are very likely. Highest tier guardsmen or large groups of mercenaries will be the first to suffer losses. This is where two tiers will help you individually.
- Don't use your hero to save unnecessary leveling.
- Use guardsmen and monsters. Mercenaries can be used in large groups at your own risk.

Heroic monsters are crucial for obtaining clan resources for research and building. This will help improve all areas of your city: improved march speed, construction speed, troop strength, resource production, etc.
