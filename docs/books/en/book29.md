#### Pocket Fort - Part 1

The clan capital is protected by your forts. Once the forts are destroyed the capital then pops up a 20 hour shield.

Damaged forts cannot be repaired for 40 hours. This leaves us with a 20 hour window where the clan capital can be attacked once the shield falls.

#### What can you do?

There is an advanced strategy to protect your capital in this scenario. I will post full instructions in part 2.

This is a brief explanation to help you prepare for kingdom opening.

- Keep one fort unbuilt at all times.
- To activate another bonus you can temporarily build then demolish your spare.
- In the event your forts get destroyed the unbuilt fort is built in order to recharge your shield and thus protecting the capital.

I will post the full steps in part 2. But now is the time to free up or unlock a spare fort before kingdom opening!
