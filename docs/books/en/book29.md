    <h4>Pocket Fort - Part 1</h4>
    <p>The clan capital is protected by your forts. Once the forts are destroyed the capital then pops up a 20 hour shield.</p>
    <p>Damaged forts cannot be repaired for 40 hours. This leaves us with a 20 hour window where the clan capital can be attacked once the shield falls.</p>

    <h4>What can you do?</h4>
    <p>There is an advanced strategy to protect your capital in this scenario. I will post full instructions in part 2.</p>
    <p>This is a brief explanation to help you prepare for kingdom opening.</p>
</div>
<ul>
    <li>Keep one fort unbuilt at all times.</li>
    <li>To activate another bonus you can temporarily build then demolish your spare.</li>
    <li>In the event your forts get destroyed the unbuilt fort is built in order to recharge your shield and thus protecting the capital.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will post the full steps in part 2. But now is the time to free up or unlock a spare fort before kingdom opening!</p>
