    <h5>Why do I send tax?</h5>
    <p>Gold ingots are useless to a player. When we send gold ingots as tax they are sent to the kingdom palace. The palace can then use these ingots to purchase bonuses that affect every player kingdom wide.</p>
    <p><strong>Hoarding ingots is hurting yourself, and your friends!</strong></p>
