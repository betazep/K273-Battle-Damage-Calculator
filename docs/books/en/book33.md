This event takes place every 24 days and can help you obtain better quality equipment with less effort.

#### Troop ratio

Take as many different troops as possible on each march and stack using this ratio:

- 1: Rider
- 2: Archers
- 2: Spearmen

Completing personal goals earns coins, which you can exchange for equipment in the Hellforge shop during the tournament. Equipment items of a selected quality can be purchased directly.

Coins are saved between each event and do not disappear.

Hellforge saves you time and tar that you might otherwise spend exploring faraway crypts.

#### Purchasing Hellforge equipment

Take your time selecting gear to buy with Hellforge coins. It may take more than one Hellforge tournament to accumulate enough coins for a good-quality piece.

Only purchase equipment if its bonuses exceed what you can make in the Forge Workshop. For example, blue Tomb Raider gear offers the same crypting efficiency as the lowest-tier Omniscience gear. Godlike Tomb Raider gear matches the efficiency of purple Omniscience.
