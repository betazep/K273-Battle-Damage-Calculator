    <h4>Troop ratio</h4>
    <p>Take as many different troops as possible on each march and stack using this ratio:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1: Rider</li>
        <li>2: Archers</li>
        <li>2: Spearmen</li>
    </ul>

<p>Completing personal goals earns coins, which you can exchange for equipment in the Hellforge shop during the tournament. Equipment items of a selected quality can be purchased directly.</p>
<p>Coins are saved between each event and do not disappear.</p>
<p>Hellforge saves you time and tar that you might otherwise spend exploring faraway crypts.</p>

    <h4>Purchasing Hellforge equipment</h4>
    <p>Take your time selecting gear to buy with Hellforge coins. It may take more than one Hellforge tournament to accumulate enough coins for a good-quality piece.</p>
    <p>Only purchase equipment if its bonuses exceed what you can make in the Forge Workshop. For example, blue Tomb Raider gear offers the same crypting efficiency as the lowest-tier Omniscience gear. Godlike Tomb Raider gear matches the efficiency of purple Omniscience.</p>
