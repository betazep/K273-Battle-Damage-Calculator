This guide is based on my experience and knowledge as a growing leader.

- Make sure new players are active and responsive. Active players opening chests drives wealth. Vet them from the beginning.
- Educate players as they join on the importance of prioritising Carter with leveling and research.
- Set weekly crypt targets for members and review them. We hit 30m wealth with 45 players with a 21 weekly crypt target.
- Drive Tin-man participation. This event does wonders for your wealth score. Monitor participation.
- Educate members on the benefits of the golden pass. Be encouraging but don't ever force people to use real money. The pass drives Tar gains.
- Educate new members upon request of the benefit of Wellsprings.
- Educate the clan on the benefits and rewards of crypting.

**1 chest x (Amount of members) x Activity = Wealth**
