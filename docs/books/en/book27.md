<p>This guide is based on my experience and knowledge as a growing leader.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure new players are active and responsive. Active players opening chests drives wealth. Vet them from the beginning.</li>
    <li>Educate players as they join on the importance of prioritising Carter with leveling and research.</li>
    <li>Set weekly crypt targets for members and review them. We hit 30m wealth with 45 players with a 21 weekly crypt target.</li>
    <li>Drive Tin-man participation. This event does wonders for your wealth score. Monitor participation.</li>
    <li>Educate members on the benefits of the golden pass. Be encouraging but don't ever force people to use real money. The pass drives Tar gains.</li>
    <li>Educate new members upon request of the benefit of Wellsprings.</li>
    <li>Educate the clan on the benefits and rewards of crypting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1 chest x (Amount of members) x Activity = Wealth</strong></p>
