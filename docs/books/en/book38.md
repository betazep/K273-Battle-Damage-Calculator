Please read part 1 before reading this. The instructions I will try to keep as simple as possible.

#### Instructions

- All your forts are destroyed and your shield has deployed on your capital.
- Before your shield is about to expire, begin building your spare fort but do not complete until your shield is about to expire.
- Complete the build as the shield is about to fall, enter the clan capital menu and hit "recharge".

These are very basic instructions but there is several factors to consider. Best strategy will be to delegate jobs to superiors for this.

#### Warnings

- Don't complete the building of the fort too far in advance of the shield falling. If it's attacked before you recharge you are screwed...
- Don't press "help" when you build the fort, for the same reason mentioned.

I will make a part 3 to finalise this topic.
