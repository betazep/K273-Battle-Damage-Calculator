#### Guardsmen level 4 and above
Artifacts are permanent boosts for your Captains, providing bonuses. Level them up with fragments and experience from events, while books allow quick levels added to the artifact and a might boost.

Use artifacts with the correct equipment for different Captain/Hero roles (fighting, building) to optimize their stats. Think of artifacts as permanent skills.

Your keys can be found in your Summoning Circle (left of your city capital). Once you claim them, click a Captain and the small circle to the left to place an artifact on captains.

To use your books, click the artifact you would like to level, select Details, and use the top arrow pointing upwards.

This gives a huge might boost. Keys and book rewards are given during the Pursuit of Experience event.
