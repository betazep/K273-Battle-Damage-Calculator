    <h4>Guardsmen level 4 and above</h4>
    <p>Artifacts are permanent boosts for your Captains, providing bonuses. Level them up with fragments and experience from events, while books allow quick levels added to the artifact and a might boost.</p>
    <p>Use artifacts with the correct equipment for different Captain/Hero roles (fighting, building) to optimize their stats. Think of artifacts as permanent skills.</p>
</div>
<p>Your keys can be found in your Summoning Circle (left of your city capital). Once you claim them, click a Captain and the small circle to the left to place an artifact on captains.</p>
<p>To use your books, click the artifact you would like to level, select Details, and use the top arrow pointing upwards.</p>
<p>This gives a huge might boost. Keys and book rewards are given during the Pursuit of Experience event.</p>
