#### What does the kingdom opening mean?
Right now our Kingdom is closed or protected, similar to how a Shield of Peace protects cities. When the Kingdom opens, it means that we will have access to other Kingdoms and they will have access to us.

As a result, we will be able to participate in several new tournaments.

Ayrin players from our Kingdom will also have the opportunity to attack players in other kingdoms for CP, resources and gold ingots to bring back to our Kingdom. Of course, we can also be scouted and attacked by players from other Kingdoms at any time, so *it is very important now to get into the habit of having a no-value city.*

#### What new tournaments?
The biggest, most important ones for your clans will be Trials of Olympus, Dark Omens, Clash of Kingdoms, and Trade Routes (mercenary exchanges).

However, there are many other mini tournaments for personal rewards (Wargames, Silver Rush, Gold Rush) where getting a place on the leaderboard is possible with an open Kingdom.

#### I don't like the idea of being attacked all the time
It's very easy to prevent attacks; simply keep your city from having any value to outsiders. Keep your resources below the protected limits of your warehouse, send your troops to the fort when going offline, and pay your taxes!

Our newly opened Kingdom will be a source of curiosity for the first few weeks, so expect lots of scouting. However, if we keep our cities valueless to attackers, they will slowly stop visiting.

#### What's so special about Ayrin?
Ayrin is the only Hero who can access other Kingdoms at any time you desire. Players using other heroes have access restricted to certain tournaments and can only travel using special portals.

Ayrin is best for PvP growth-focused players as she allows you to prioritize raiding other Kingdoms for silver, RSS, and gold ingots.
