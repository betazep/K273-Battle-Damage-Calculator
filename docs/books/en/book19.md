<p>I've just ran a little test in my own city to try and find a simple but safe strategy going forward, and this is what I would advise.</p>
<ul>
    <li>As a new city and player 12/12 Farms/Mansions is completely fine. But as time goes on you will need to reduce your mansions and have more farms.</li>
    <li>The simple strategy to save demolishing your city is to have 6 mansions. You can deviate from this strategy +3 or -3 depending on a few factors.</li>
</ul>
<div class="book-section">
    <h4>Factors to consider</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Do/Don't have Captain Helen.</li>
        <li>Tile bonus.</li>
        <li>Play style.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>In simple terms I would use 6 mansions as the default number and then feel free to deviate +3 or -3 depending on the above factors.</p>
<p>It's important you only level one at a time and don't try to level them all equally. The production increase is more substantial at the higher levels.</p>
<p>Captain Helen (need the golden pass to get her).</p>
