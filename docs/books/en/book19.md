I've just ran a little test in my own city to try and find a simple but safe strategy going forward, and this is what I would advise.

- As a new city and player 12/12 Farms/Mansions is completely fine. But as time goes on you will need to reduce your mansions and have more farms.
- The simple strategy to save demolishing your city is to have 6 mansions. You can deviate from this strategy +3 or -3 depending on a few factors.

#### Factors to consider
- Do/Don't have Captain Helen.
- Tile bonus.
- Play style.

In simple terms I would use 6 mansions as the default number and then feel free to deviate +3 or -3 depending on the above factors.

It's important you only level one at a time and don't try to level them all equally. The production increase is more substantial at the higher levels.

Captain Helen (need the golden pass to get her).
