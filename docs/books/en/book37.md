#### Initiative Stat

This is the main factor; troops with higher Initiative always strike first in a round (one attack for each side).

#### Stacking for Control

Create large, equally-sized stacks based on total health (Health per Troop x Number of Troops).

This makes your strongest troops (highest health/level) attack first within that stack, allowing you to target specific enemy types first.

If you send many small stacks, the enemy's big stack might hit first, disrupting your plan.

#### Troop Types & Bonuses

- Guardsmen: Attack monsters effectively.
- Specialists: Attack other players' troops.
- Engineer Corps: Attack fortifications.
- Monsters: High base stats, good for general damage.

#### How it Plays Out

Your highest initiative stack attacks first, targeting the enemy squad it deals most damage to.

Then the enemy's highest initiative stack attacks, and so on.

If initiative is tied, it's 50/50.
