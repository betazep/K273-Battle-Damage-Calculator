#### Doomsday

**Suicide your army to earn XP and Valor (your troops will die).**

- Activate bonuses beforehand.
- If you can't send large armies, use strongest troops only.
- If you can build large armies, stack troops.
- Level Carter as a priority.
- Use Valor to research Archeology and Guardsmen.

**Save your mercenaries (epic monster hunters) for these events.**
