## Senate Chat Rules - King Election

### Purpose
The chat K273 King Election exists for the Top 100 tournament players to discuss and vote for our next King. Let's keep it focused and respectful.

### Chat Administration
This chat is administered by me (Nakasa). I will be actively monitoring and enforcing these rules. Players who do not follow the rules will be removed from the Senate chat.

### Core Rules

#### 1. Stay On Topic
Discussions should relate to King nominations, qualifications, and voting.
Campaign speeches and candidate questions are welcome.
Off-topic conversations belong in other chats.

#### 2. One Nomination Per Message
When nominating someone, use clear format: "I nominate [Player Name] for King".
Include 1-2 sentences explaining why.
Avoid spam-nominating the same person repeatedly.

#### 3. Respectful Debate Only
Support your candidate's strengths, don't trash others.
Criticism of qualifications is fine; personal attacks are not.
Keep language appropriate for all players.

#### 4. No Campaign Spam
Limit self-promotion or candidate promotion to 3 messages per hour.
No ALL CAPS shouting.
No copy-paste spam of the same message.

#### 5. Voting Process
All official votes must be cast through the Event Page in the game.
This chat is for discussion and debate only.
Do not post "I vote for X" messages here - go to the Event Page.
One vote per player - you cannot change your vote on the Event Page once voted.

### Consequences
First offense: Warning.
Second offense: 24-hour chat mute.
Third offense: Removed from Senate chat for remainder of election.

I reserve the right to remove any player immediately for severe violations (harassment, threats, or extreme disruption).

### Remember
We're the Top 100. Let's act like leaders and set an example for the kingdom.
