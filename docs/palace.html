                        <li>Cities with over 3 days of accrued ingots may be attacked by a member of the Royal Guard after being given 24 hours warning. Gold ingots have zero value to you personally, but the King can use them to turn on bonuses for the whole kingdom. If we have the gold bars, they will be used for the benefit of K273.</li>
                        <li>Maximum gold ingots per city:
                            <ul>
                                <li>City 1-9: 2000 Ingots</li>

                <li>
                    <h3>6. Members of the Esteemed Kingdom</h3>
                    <ul class="roe-points">
                        <li>Every player must abide by these rules to be protected by ROE. Players not protected are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>OUTLAWS</li>
                                <li>CLANLESS PLAYERS</li>
                                <li>NON-ROE MEMBERS</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Outlaws – If individuals or clans are unwilling to comply with ROE, who attack clan buildings, or refuse to pay compensation for ROE violations will receive outlaw status. Current Outlaws can be found at #K273/OUTLAWS. The current list of outlaws will be struck clean and start new. This means there are currently no outlaws in the kingdom. The new Royal Guard will share responsibilities in kingdom assistance.</li>
                        <li>Royal Guard: The new Royal Guard is comprised of many clans and has very strong players as members. The RG duties will continue its normal duties like tax collection and enforcement for the Palace. Additional duties will now include assistance in helping clans with outlaws and the kingdom with precision. They will also act as an elite army and kingdom/territorial patrol and defense unit.</li>
                        <li>In addition to activating relationships with the greater clans of the kingdom to assist as needed.</li>
                        <li>Clanless players at or below 250k might are protected and not to be freely attacked.</li>
                        <li>Clanless players less than 250k might attacked are allowed 2x the compensation amount in claims.</li>
                        <li>Interactions with these players should first be to learn about them and their goals in the game. Followed by encouragement to join a clan. Foster growth in the game and play for the kingdom versus personal reward.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>7. Clash of Thrones  CoT</h3>
                    <ul class="roe-points">
                        <li>During, you can scout and attack cities under the following conditions:</li>
                        <li>No Clan Fort Attacks: Attacking another clan's forts or buildings is strictly forbidden.</li>
                        <li>Portal Management: No might restriction applies. Any portal proven to be hostile to clan territories may be attacked with swift justice by the clan being attacked. Clan marches are fully allowed to close hostile portals. During normal peacetime, portals may not be attacked at any time unless proven hostile.</li>
                        <li>Resource Management: Keep resources low during the event to avoid theft; send troops to forts if needed. Practice No Value City (NVC)</li>
                        <li>"Fair Play": Attacking someone significantly weaker (e.g., under half your might) is often considered poor sportsmanship and not allowed. The only instance it is allowed is for a hostile portal. Portals left open by players that have other members attack through them are still at fault for leaving the portal open and may be attacked regardless of their might. An attack report must be provided in all claims made. Under half your might is not allowed. The 50% rule applies.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>8. Conflict Resolution Process</h3>
                    <ul class="roe-points">
                        <li>When the ROE is violated, the following steps should be taken:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Contact the other player to attempt to resolve. If no resolution within 24 hours, elevate to your clan diplomat.</li>
                                <li>If no resolution is reached between clan Diplomats, they may bring the issue before the Court by posting it in #K273/CLAIMS. Only Clan leaders or diplomats are allowed to post claims in this chat.</li>
                                <li>The judges will adjudicate to define the guilty party (if any) and an acceptable amount of compensation.</li>
                                <li>If the guilty party (or their clan) refuses to compensate, the Royal Court will determine whether the player or clan should be declared an Outlaw and the Royal Guard will be activated on stand-by.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
