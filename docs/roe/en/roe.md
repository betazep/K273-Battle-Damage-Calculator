By order of King Spunky the following ROE takes immediate effect across Kingdom 273 and EVERY player must abide by the rules, except:

- OUTLAWS
- CLANLESS PLAYERS
- NON ROE FOLLOWING CLANS

To show your clan follows ROE your clan description must state "We follow K273 ROE".

### 1. General statement K273 Player Agreement

- Kingdom K273 follows the IKFPA agreement established during the reign of King Arcadia and expects every member to comply accordingly, especially after Kingdom open.
- The ROE is effective immediately and may be amended.
- Each amendment will have a 24-hour buffer so others may adapt via various time zones.
- Please respect all who you come into contact with.
- There is a zero-tolerance policy against racist, hateful, derogatory, or threatening language.
- Violations may be reported to the King/Queen or the Hand of the King.
- They may be assigned a negative title and/or outlaw status.
- Threats are taken very seriously, as is bullying, as they are against the TOTAL BATTLE Code of Conduct rules and Kingdom chat is a place for all to feel welcome.

### Inter-Kingdom Fair Play Agreement (IKFPA) rules

These are general agreements between different Kingdoms for when K273 opens. They are not hard rules but are encouraged by Kingdoms to uphold.

1. No hate speech.
1. No attacks on clan buildings, memorial portals, or players under 100K might.
1. ALL RSS tiles are protected from attacks except during PvP events. PvP events are: CoT, KvK, War Tools, Gold / Silver Rush, War Games, Lava Trials (does NOT include Ruthless Slaughter specifically).
1. Fort attacks on other kingdoms declared immediate outlaw status per kingdom ROE.
1. Compensation for violations agreed upon <48 hrs (IKFPA is not enforced by any single entity).

### 2. PEACETIME

- Attacks on ROE cities and portals are forbidden except during CoT or planned CP exchanges.
- Players under 100k are protected under ROE (whether they follow ROE or not).
- Players and clans that do not follow ROE and over 100k might can be attacked at anytime.
- Outlaws can be attacked at anytime, no might limit.
- If you're hit illegally during peace time you or a clan member can hit them back once as retaliation no might limit. (no compensation if retaliation hit)
- Scouting is a form of aggression and is against ROE during peace time.

### 3. DIPLOMATS

Clans must identify at least one diplomat in their clan description. Diplomats must be an active clan leader or superior. Diplomats speak for their clan to the kingdom, help resolve problems and should be your first line of call.

### 4. OBLIGATION OF CLAN LEADERS

Set the tone and protect the clan's reputation, foster a positive environment. Teach and mentor and communicate goals and updates to members, or delegate this to Superiors.

### 5. CLASH FOR THE THRONE (COT)

During COT, you can scout and attack cities under the following conditions:

#### CITIES

You cannot attack or scout a player's city with less than HALF your power/might unless in the top 50 COT rankings. If in top 50 no might limit and can attack each other freely.

#### CLAN MARCHES

You cannot use reinforcements to attack cities. You can use reinforcements to attack hostile portals. Battle report required as proof of attack.

#### PORTALS

Event portals can not be hit at any time even during COT. All other wild portals and portals within the clan border can be attacked with no might limit.

#### CLAN FORTS

It's prohibited to attack clan forts/buildings. Doing so carries penalties and may result in Outlaw status.

### 6. MONSTERS & CRYPTS

- All monsters, arenas, citadels, and crypts are first come, first serve regardless of its location, except Rare Crypts which require a key to open. If you did not unlock it then do not take it.
- MINES/RESOURCES (RSS) TILES - Player created resources are owned by the person that created the tile using architect Blueprints. The owner of the mine, member of their clan or the RG has the right to attack and reclaim without warning.

- All wild resource and game generated resources are first come first served.
- No mining in other clans territory or you will be removed.

#### WS and DMs

- There is no registration system, first come, first served.
- Claims cannot be made if you are scouted/attacked in wild resources unless:

  - You lose the resource.
  - You are scouted/attacked and then attacked again. (2x rule)

- It is your responsibility to message your diplomat, the other player, and the opposing diplomat/clan leader if someone is scouting you or attacking you in a mine.

### 7. COMPENSATION GUIDE

Please see k273tb.xyz for compensation calculator. Every illegal attack or scouting carries a base cost of 1 million silver. Any additional losses, damages, or stolen resources are added on top of this base cost.

- RSS: amount equal to the amount stolen
- Gold: 1 Gold = 3,000 Silver or gold mines equal to stolen + 10% (by decision of the victim)
- Tar: 1 Tar = 1,000 Silver
- Gold Bars = no compensation
- Illegally closed portal: 1M silver (+1M for illegal attack itself)
- Damage is calculated according to the following formula: Damage of lost troops are calculated according to the following formula:

  - Hero = 1.5k
  - Captain = 1k
  - Spearmen, Archers = Troops Level x 40
  - Specialists, Riders = Troops Level x 80
  - Spies = Troops Level x 100
  - Griffins = Troops Level x 800
  - Catapults, Walls Walls Level x 200
  - Monsters III-VII (Monster Level 2) x 1.3k
  - Monsters I & II = x 8.64k
  - Mercenary Guard Troops Level x 120
  - Mercenary Monster = Monster Level x 3k

#### FORTS

- Scouting = 5 million silver
- Attacking without destroying = 10 million silver
- Attacking and destroying = 50 million of each Silver, Iron, Wood, Stone

### 8. OUTLAWS

If individuals or clans are unwilling to comply with ROE, who attack clan buildings, or refuse to pay compensation for ROE violations will receive outlaw status. Current outlaws can be found on the chat: K273#OUTLAWS.

### 9. ROLES WITHIN THE PALACE

- The King is responsible for governing the Kingdom, but the entire Palace system is a collaborative effort.
- The King, Queen and Hand of the King have access to the kingdom's treasury to turn on Kingdom bonuses.
- CENTURION - Head of the Royal Guard.
- ARCHON - Head of the Court/Chief Judge.
- CHANCELLOR - Head of the council of clans.
- TREASURER - Managing tax collections.
- QUESTOR - Manages communications and mines.
- LEGATE - Head of Diplomacy.
- TRIBUNE - Represents a voice for all players and clans.

### 10. VIOLATIONS

All controversial issues should be attempted to be resolved first among the Players themselves. If they cannot resolve it, then the next step is to involve the clan Diplomat. If the Diplomats cannot find a common solution, then they turn to the Courts. The decisions of the Courts and Judges are not negotiable.

### 11. TAXES

From now, no more advance notice before ingot collection raid. If ingots are too high, RG will scout and then collect.

- Every clan should appoint an officer as Tax Officer within their clans to check everyone's ingots daily and remind any who have too many.
- RG have a lot to do before opening so I hope no more collection raids are needed.

Maximum gold ingots per city

- City 1-9 2000 ingots
- City 10-19 3000 ingots
- City 20-24 10000 ingots
- City 25-29 35000 ingots
- City 30-34 60000 ingots
- City 35-39 70000 ingots
- City 40+ 90000 ingots
