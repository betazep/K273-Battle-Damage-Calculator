        </ul>
        <p><strong>Outlaw status</strong></p>
        <p>The authority to declare a citizen or a clan an Outlaw, or to revoke an existing outlaw status, rests exclusively with the following powers of the Kingdom:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>The King, supreme guardian of order and justice.</li>
            <li>The Hand of the King, acting as the direct representative of royal authority.</li>
            <li>The Queen, as co-holder of the royal authority.</li>
            <li>The Chief Judge of the Kingdom's Tribunal, by virtue of his role as guardian of justice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No other actor of the Kingdom may, without an explicit mandate granted by one of these authorities, declare a citizen or a clan outlaw. Any declaration issued by an unauthorized actor shall be null and void.</p>
        <p><strong>Royal Guard</strong></p>
        <p>The Royal Guard is composed of many clans and has various levels of players as members. The RG duties will continue its normal duties like tax collection and enforcement for the Palace. They will also act as an elite army and kingdom/territorial patrol and defense unit. They are the tip of the spear for the kingdom and are here to assist clans having trouble with players and outlaws.</p>

        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Contact the other player to attempt to resolve. If no resolution within 24 hours, elevate to your clan diplomat.</li>
            <li>If no resolution is reached between clan diplomats, they may bring the issue before the Court by posting it in #K273/CLAIMS. Only clan leaders or diplomats are allowed to post claims in this chat.</li>
            <li>The judges will adjudicate to define the guilty party (if any) and an acceptable amount of compensation.</li>
            <li>If the guilty party (or their clan) refuses to compensate, the Archon or Head Judge will determine whether the player or clan should be declared an Outlaw and the Royal Guard will be activated on stand-by.</li>
