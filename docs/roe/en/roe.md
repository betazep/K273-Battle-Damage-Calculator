### 4. PALACE COMPENSATION GUIDE

- Tar: 1 Tar = 1,000 Silver
- Gold Bars = no compensation
- Illegally closed portal: 1M silver (+1M for illegal attack itself)
- Damage is calculated according to the following formula: Damage of lost troops are calculated according to the following formula:

  - Hero = 1.5k
  - Captain = 1k
  - Spearmen, Archers = Troops Level x 40
  - Specialists, Riders = Troops Level x 80
  - Spies = Troops Level x 100

  - Monsters III-VII (Monster Level - 2) x 1.3k
  - Monsters I & II = x 8.64k
  - Mercenary Guard Troops Level x 120
  - Mercenary Monster = Monster Level x 3k

- - FORTS -

  - Scouting = 5 million silver

- - CAPITALS -

  - Attacking without destroying = 10 million silver
  - Attacking and destroying = 50 million of each Silver, Iron, Wood, Stone

### 5. TAXES

- Cities with over 3 days of accrued ingots may be attacked by a member of the Royal Guard 24 hours after warning the player and clan leader. Gold ingots have zero value to you personally, but the King and Palace can use them to turn on bonuses for the whole kingdom. If we have the gold bars, they will be used for the benefit of K273.
- Maximum gold ingots per city:

  - City 1-9: 2000 Ingots
  - City 10-19: 3000 Ingots
  - City 20-24: 10000 Ingots
  - City 25-29: 35000 Ingots
  - City 30-34: 60000 Ingots
  - City 35-39: 70000 Ingots
  - City 40+: 90000 Ingots

### 6. Members of the Esteemed Kingdom

- Every player must abide by these rules to be protected by ROE. Players not protected are:

  - OUTLAWS
  - CLANLESS PLAYERS (most)
  - NON-ROE MEMBERS

- Protected clanless players: All players at or below 100k might are protected and are not to be freely attacked. Interactions with clanless players should first be to learn about them and their goals in the game, followed by encouragement to join a clan. Foster growth in the game and play for the kingdom versus personal reward.

Outlaw status

The authority to declare a citizen or a clan an Outlaw, or to revoke an existing outlaw status, rests exclusively with the following powers of the Kingdom:

- The King, supreme guardian of order and justice.
- The Hand of the King, acting as the direct representative of royal authority.
- The Queen, as co-holder of the royal authority.
- The Chief Judge of the Kingdom's Tribunal, by virtue of his role as guardian of justice.

No other actor of the Kingdom may, without an explicit mandate granted by one of these authorities, declare a citizen or a clan outlaw. Any declaration issued by an unauthorized actor shall be null and void.

**Royal Guard**

The Royal Guard is composed of many clans and has various levels of players as members. The RG duties will continue its normal duties like tax collection and enforcement for the Palace. They will also act as an elite army and kingdom/territorial patrol and defense unit. They are the tip of the spear for the kingdom and are here to assist clans having trouble with players and outlaws.

### 7. Clash of Thrones CoT

- During, you can scout and attack cities under the following conditions:
- No Clan Fort Attacks: Attacking another clan's forts or buildings is strictly forbidden.

Resource Management

Keep resources low during the event to avoid theft; send troops to forts if needed. Practice No Value City (NVC).

"Fair Play"
- The 50% rule applies.
- If you are attacked, regardless of their might, you are allowed to attack anyone back. Meaning, if a 1,000,000 might player attacks a 50,000,000 might player, the 50,000,000 might player has full rights to attack back if they choose.

### 8. Conflict Resolution Process

When the ROE is violated, the following steps should be taken:

- Contact the other player to attempt to resolve. If no resolution within 24 hours, elevate to your clan diplomat.
- If no resolution is reached between clan diplomats, they may bring the issue before the Court by posting it in #K273/CLAIMS. Only clan leaders or diplomats are allowed to post claims in this chat.
- The judges will adjudicate to define the guilty party (if any) and an acceptable amount of compensation.
- If the guilty party (or their clan) refuses to compensate, the Archon or Head Judge will determine whether the player or clan should be declared an Outlaw and the Royal Guard will be activated on stand-by.
