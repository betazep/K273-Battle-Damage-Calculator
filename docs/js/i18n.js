            <li>Attacks on clan buildings are prohibited.</li>
            <li>Peacetime Portals: No touchy or boop boops unless CoT. This means no attacking any portals anywhere unless proven hostile.

Attacking portals in clan territories for clan activities is not allowed unless hostile.</li>
            <li>CoT Portal Rules: No restrictions.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>4. PALACE COMPENSATION GUIDE</h3>
        <p>Please see k273tb.xyz for compensation calculator.</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Every illegal attack or scouting carries a base cost of 1 million silver. Any additional losses, damages, or stolen resources are added on top of this base cost.</li>
            <li>RSS: amount equal to the amount stolen</li>
            <li>Gold: 1 Gold = 3,000 Silver or gold mines equal to stolen + 10% (by decision of the victim)</li>
            <li>Tar: 1 Tar = 1,000 Silver</li>
            <li>Gold Bars = no compensation</li>
            <li>Illegally closed portal: 1M silver (+1M for illegal attack itself)</li>
            <li>Damage is calculated according to the following formula: Damage of lost troops are calculated according to the following formula:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hero = 1.5k</li>
                    <li>Captain = 1k</li>
                    <li>Spearmen, Archers = Troops Level x 40</li>
                    <li>Specialists, Riders = Troops Level x 80</li>
                    <li>Spies = Troops Level x 100</li>
                    <li>Griffins = Troops Level x 800</li>
                    <li>Catapults, Walls Walls Level x 200</li>
                    <li>Monsters III-VII (Monster Level - 2) x 1.3k</li>
                    <li>Monsters I &amp; II = x 8.64k</li>

        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Cities with over 3 days of accrued ingots may be attacked by a member of the Royal Guard 24 hours after warning the player and clan leader. Gold ingots have zero value to you personally, but the King and Palace can use them to turn on bonuses for the whole kingdom. If we have the gold bars, they will be used for the benefit of K273.</li>
            <li>Maximum gold ingots per city:
                <ul>
                    <li>City 1-9: 2000 Ingots</li>
                    <li>City 10-19: 3000 Ingots</li>

        <h3>6. Members of the Esteemed Kingdom</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Every player must abide by these rules to be protected by ROE. Players not protected are:
                <ul>
                    <li>OUTLAWS</li>
                    <li>CLANLESS PLAYERS (most)</li>
                    <li>NON-ROE MEMBERS</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Protected clanless players: All players at or below 100k might are protected and are not to be freely attacked. Interactions with clanless players should first be to learn about them and their goals in the game, followed by encouragement to join a clan. Foster growth in the game and play for the kingdom versus personal reward.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Outlaw status</strong></p>
        <p>The authority to declare a citizen or a clan an Outlaw, or to revoke an existing outlaw status, rests exclusively with the following powers of the Kingdom:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>The King, supreme guardian of order and justice.</li>
            <li>The Hand of the King, acting as the direct representative of royal authority.</li>
            <li>The Queen, as co-holder of the royal authority.</li>
            <li>The Chief Judge of the Kingdom's Tribunal, by virtue of his role as guardian of justice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No other actor of the Kingdom may, without an explicit mandate granted by one of these authorities, declare a citizen or a clan outlaw. Any declaration issued by an unauthorized actor shall be null and void.</p>
        <p><strong>Royal Guard</strong></p>
        <p>The Royal Guard is composed of many clans and has various levels of players as members. The RG duties will continue its normal duties like tax collection and enforcement for the Palace. They will also act as an elite army and kingdom/territorial patrol and defense unit. They are the tip of the spear for the kingdom and are here to assist clans having trouble with players and outlaws.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones CoT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>During, you can scout and attack cities under the following conditions:</li>
            <li>No Clan Fort Attacks: Attacking another clan's forts or buildings is strictly forbidden.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Resource Management</strong></p>
        <p>Keep resources low during the event to avoid theft; send troops to forts if needed. Practice No Value City (NVC).</p>
        <p><strong>"Fair Play"</strong></p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>The 50% rule applies.</li>
            <li>If you are attacked, regardless of their might, you are allowed to attack anyone back. Meaning, if a 1,000,000 might player attacks a 50,000,000 might player, the 50,000,000 might player has full rights to attack back if they choose.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>8. Conflict Resolution Process</h3>
        <p>When the ROE is violated, the following steps should be taken:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Contact the other player to attempt to resolve. If no resolution within 24 hours, elevate to your clan diplomat.</li>
            <li>If no resolution is reached between clan diplomats, they may bring the issue before the Court by posting it in #K273/CLAIMS. Only clan leaders or diplomats are allowed to post claims in this chat.</li>
            <li>The judges will adjudicate to define the guilty party (if any) and an acceptable amount of compensation.</li>
            <li>If the guilty party (or their clan) refuses to compensate, the Archon or Head Judge will determine whether the player or clan should be declared an Outlaw and the Royal Guard will be activated on stand-by.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

        <h3>K273:n yleinen pelaajasopimus</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Kuningaskunta K273 noudattaa IKFPA-sopimusta, joka luotiin kuningas Arcadian valtakaudella, ja odottaa jokaisen jäsenen noudattavan sitä, erityisesti kuningaskunnan avautumisen jälkeen.</li>
            <li>ROE on voimassa välittömästi ja sitä voidaan muuttaa.</li>
            <li>Jokaisella muutoksella on 24 tunnin siirtymäaika, jotta muut voivat sopeutua eri aikavyöhykkeiden vuoksi.</li>
            <li>Kunnioita kaikkia, joiden kanssa olet tekemisissä.</li>
            <li>Rasistista, vihamielistä, halventavaa tai uhkaavaa kieltä kohtaan on nollatoleranssi.</li>

            <li>Heille voidaan antaa negatiivinen titteli ja/tai lainsuojattoman status.</li>
            <li>Uhkaus ja kiusaaminen otetaan erittäin vakavasti, sillä ne ovat TOTAL BATTLE -käytännesääntöjen vastaisia. Kuningaskunnan chat on paikka, jossa kaikkien tulee tuntea olonsa tervetulleeksi.</li>

        <p>Nämä ovat yleisiä sopimuksia eri kuningaskuntien välillä K273:n avautuessa. Ne eivät ole tiukkoja sääntöjä, mutta kuningaskunnat rohkaisevat noudattamaan niitä.</p>

            <li>Linnoitushyökkäykset muihin kuningaskuntiin johtavat välittömään lainsuojattomuuteen kuningaskunnan ROE:n mukaisesti.</li>
            <li>Korvaukset rikkomuksista sovitaan 48 tunnin kuluessa (IKFPA:ta ei valvo mikään yksittäinen taho).</li>

            <li>Palatsi vastaa kunnian, rehellisyyden ja rauhan ylläpidosta K273:ssa ja muiden kuningaskuntien kanssa.</li>
            <li>Kuningas valitaan edustamaan K273:n kansalaisia ja johtamaan palatsia.</li>

        <h3>Klaanijohtajien velvollisuudet</h3>
        <p>Kaikkien klaanijohtajien on täytettävä velvollisuutensa johtajina:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Kunnioittaa ROE:ta (Rules of Engagement).</li>
            <li>Varmistaa, että heidän jäsenensä kunnioittavat ja noudattavat ROE:ta.</li>

            <li>Rauhanajan portaalit: Ei kosketa tai boop boop -hyökkäyksiä ilman CoT:ia. Tämä tarkoittaa, ettei portaalien hyökkääminen ole sallittua missään, ellei portaalia ole todistettu vihamieliseksi. Vihamielisiin portaaleihin kuuluvat hyökkäykset klaanien rakennuksiin, jäseniin ja kaikkiin pelin resursseihin (mukaan lukien kausitapahtumien resurssit). Portaaleihin hyökkääminen klaanialueilla klaanitoimintoja varten ei ole sallittua, ellei portaali ole vihamielinen.</li>
            <li>CoT-portaalisäännöt: Ei rajoituksia.</li>
            <li>Tiedustelu on aggression muoto ja on laitonta rauhan aikana.</li>
            <li>Jos sinua hyökätään, riippumatta heidän mightistaan, sinulla on oikeus hyökätä ketä tahansa takaisin milloin tahansa. Toisin sanoen, jos 1,000,000 mightin pelaaja hyökkää 50,000,000 mightin pelaajan kimppuun, 50,000,000 mightin pelaajalla on täysi oikeus hyökätä takaisin, jos hän niin haluaa.</li>

        <h3>2. KLAANIT &amp; DIPLOMAATIT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Klaanien tulisi ilmoittaa "We abide by K273 ROE", jotta kuningaskunta palvelee heitä ja he ovat ROE:n suojaamia.</li>
            <li>Klaanien on nimettävä vähintään yksi diplomaatti klaanikuvauksen alkuun, joka voi auttaa riitojen ratkaisussa. Diplomaatin on oltava aktiivinen johtaja tai ylempi.</li>

Kultaharkot eivät ole sinulle henkilökohtaisesti minkään arvoisia, mutta kuningas ja palatsi voivat käyttää niitä bonusten kytkemiseen koko kuningaskunnalle.

        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Jokaisen pelaajan on noudatettava näitä sääntöjä ollakseen ROE:n suojaama. Pelaajat, joita ei suojata, ovat:
                <ul>
                    <li>LAINSUOJATTOMAT</li>
                    <li>KLAANITTOMAT PELAAJAT (useimmat)</li>

            <li>Suojatut klaanittomat pelaajat: Kaikki pelaajat, joiden might on 100k tai vähemmän, ovat suojattuja eikä heihin saa hyökätä vapaasti. Vuorovaikutuksen klaanittomien pelaajien kanssa tulee ensin olla heidän taustansa ja tavoitteidensa selvittäminen pelissä, jota seuraa kannustus liittyä klaaniin. Edistä kasvua pelissä ja pelaa kuningaskunnan hyväksi henkilökohtaisen palkkion sijaan.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Lainsuojattoman status</strong></p>
        <p>Valta julistaa kansalainen tai klaani lainsuojattomaksi tai peruuttaa olemassa oleva lainsuojattoman status kuuluu yksinomaan seuraaville kuningaskunnan valtuuksille:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Kuningas, järjestyksen ja oikeuden ylin suojelija.</li>
            <li>Kuninkaan oikea käsi, joka toimii kuninkaallisen vallan suorana edustajana.</li>
            <li>Kuningatar, kuninkaallisen vallan yhteishaltijana.</li>
            <li>Kuningaskunnan tuomioistuimen päätuomari, oikeuden suojelijan roolinsa perusteella.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Kukaan muu kuningaskunnan toimija ei voi ilman jonkin näistä valtuuksista myönnettyä nimenomaista valtuutusta julistaa kansalaista tai klaania lainsuojattomaksi. Luvattoman toimijan antama julistus on mitätön.</p>
        <p><strong>Kuninkaallinen Kaarti</strong></p>
        <p>Kuninkaallinen Kaarti koostuu monista klaaneista ja sen jäseninä on eri tasoisia pelaajia. RG:n tehtävät jatkuvat normaaleina velvollisuuksina kuten verojen keruu ja palatsin toimeenpano. He toimivat myös eliittiarmeijana sekä kuningaskunnan/alueen partio- ja puolustusyksikkönä. He ovat kuningaskunnan keihäänkärki ja ovat täällä auttamassa klaaneja, joilla on ongelmia pelaajien ja lainsuojattomien kanssa.</p>

        <p><strong>"Reilu peli"</strong></p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>50 % sääntö on voimassa.</li>

        <p>Kun ROE:ta rikotaan, tulee tehdä seuraavat toimenpiteet:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Ota yhteyttä toiseen pelaajaan ratkaistaksesi asian. Jos ratkaisua ei synny 24 tunnin kuluessa, siirrä asia klaanidiplomaatillesi.</li>
            <li>Jos klaanidiplomaatit eivät pääse ratkaisuun, he voivat viedä asian oikeuden eteen julkaisemalla sen #K273/CLAIMS-kanavalla. Vain klaanijohtajat tai diplomaatit saavat julkaista vaatimuksia tässä chatissa.</li>
            <li>Tuomarit ratkaisevat syyllisen osapuolen (jos sellainen on) ja hyväksyttävän korvauksen määrän.</li>
            <li>Jos syyllinen osapuoli (tai heidän klaaninsa) kieltäytyy korvaamasta, Archon tai päätuomari päättää, pitäisikö pelaaja tai klaani julistaa lainsuojattomaksi, ja Kuninkaallinen Kaarti asetetaan valmiustilaan.</li>

<p class="roe-intro">På ordre fra Kong Arihelm gjelder følgende ROE for kongeriket:</p>
<ol class="roe-list">
    <li>
        <h3>Generell K273-spilleravtale</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Kongeriket K273 følger IKFPA-avtalen som ble etablert under Kong Arcadias styre og forventer at hvert medlem følger den, spesielt etter at kongeriket åpner.</li>
            <li>ROE gjelder umiddelbart og kan endres.</li>
            <li>Hver endring har en 24-timers buffer slik at andre kan tilpasse seg på tvers av tidssoner.</li>
            <li>Vennligst respekter alle du kommer i kontakt med.</li>
            <li>Det er nulltoleranse for rasistisk, hatefult, nedsettende eller truende språk.</li>
            <li>Brudd kan rapporteres til Kongen/Dronningen eller Kongens høyre hånd.</li>
            <li>De kan få en negativ tittel og/eller bli erklært fredløse.</li>
            <li>Trusler tas svært alvorlig, og det samme gjelder mobbing, da dette bryter TOTAL BATTLEs Code of Conduct. Kingdom chat er et sted hvor alle skal føle seg velkomne.</li>
            <li>Kongeriket anses som fredelig til enhver tid.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Inter-kongerikets avtale om fair play (IKFPA) regler</h3>
        <p>Dette er generelle avtaler mellom ulike kongeriker når K273 åpner. De er ikke harde regler, men kongeriker oppfordres til å følge dem.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ingen hatprat.</li>
            <li>Ingen angrep på klanbygninger, memorial portaler eller spillere under 100K might.</li>
            <li>Alle RSS-felt er beskyttet mot angrep unntatt under PvP-events. PvP-events er: CoT, KvK, War Tools, Gold / Silver Rush, War Games, Lava Trials (inkluderer IKKE Ruthless Slaughter spesielt).</li>
            <li>Fort-angrep på andre kongeriker gir umiddelbar fredløs-status per kongerikets ROE.</li>
            <li>Kompensasjon for brudd avtales innen 48 timer (IKFPA håndheves ikke av en enkelt enhet).</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Kongerikets embetsmenn - Palasset</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Palasset er ansvarlig for å opprettholde ære, integritet og fred innenfor K273 og med andre kongeriker.</li>
            <li>Kongen er valgt for å representere innbyggerne i K273 og lede palasset.</li>
            <li>Dronningen og Kongens høyre hånd er ansvarlige for å koordinere kongerikets saker og kan tale på Kongens vegne i hans fravær.</li>
            <li>Kongen, Dronningen og Kongens høyre hånd er ansvarlige for forvaltningen av skattkammeret på vegne av kongerikets spillere.</li>
            <li>Dronningen og Kongens høyre hånd må være fra forskjellige klaner.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Forpliktelser for klanledere</h3>
        <p>Alle klanledere må oppfylle sine forpliktelser som ledere:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Å respektere ROE (Rules of Engagement).</li>
            <li>Å sørge for at deres medlemmer respekterer og følger ROE.</li>
            <li>Å utdanne medlemmene for å støtte vekst og enhet i kongeriket.</li>
            <li>En leder som feiler i disse forpliktelsene skal erklæres fredløs. &gt;=D</li>
            <li>Ledere er eksempelet og standarden for kongeriket, og deres handlinger setter retningen for alle medlemmer.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>1. FREDSTID</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Angrep på byer er forbudt unntatt under CoT og planlagte CP-utvekslinger.</li>
            <li>Angrep på klanbygninger er forbudt.</li>
            <li>Fredstid portaler: Ingen berøring eller boop boops uten CoT. Dette betyr ingen angrep på portaler noe sted med mindre de er bevist fiendtlige. Fiendtlige portaler inkluderer angrep på klanens bygninger, medlemmer og alle spillressurser (inkludert sesongressurser). Å angripe portaler i klanterritorium for klanaktiviteter er ikke tillatt med mindre de er fiendtlige.</li>
            <li>CoT portalregler: Ingen restriksjoner.</li>
            <li>Speiding er en form for aggresjon og er ulovlig i fredstid.</li>
            <li>Hvis du blir angrepet, uansett deres might, har du lov til å angripe hvem som helst tilbake når som helst. Det betyr at hvis en spiller med 1,000,000 might angriper en spiller med 50,000,000 might, har 50,000,000-might-spilleren full rett til å angripe tilbake hvis de ønsker.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>2. KLANER &amp; DIPLOMATER</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Klaner bør skrive "We abide by K273 ROE" for å bli betjent av kongeriket og beskyttet av ROE.</li>
            <li>Klaner må identifisere minst én diplomat øverst i klanbeskrivelsen som kan hjelpe med tvisteløsning. Diplomater må være aktive ledere eller overordnede.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>3. Generelle regler</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Alle ressursbygninger innenfor klanterritoriet tilhører den klanen. Dette inkluderer sesongevent-ressurser.</li>
            <li>Ressurser laget av spillere tilhører den som laget dem med mindre to parter blir enige om å dele.</li>
            <li>Sjeldne kryptor tilhører den som åpnet dem.</li>
            <li>WS og DMs:
                <ul>
                    <li>a. Det finnes ikke noe registreringssystem. Alle ville ressursbygninger (inkludert DM/WS) er førstemann til mølla (FCFS).</li>
                    <li>c. Krav kan ikke gjøres hvis du blir speidet/angrepet i ville ressurser med mindre
                        <ul>
                            <li>Du mister ressursen.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>d. Det er ditt ansvar å sende melding til din diplomat, den andre spilleren og den motsatte diplomaten/klanlederen hvis noen speider deg eller angriper deg i en gruve.</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Byer med mer enn 3 dagers opptjente barrer kan angripes av et medlem av Den Kongelige Garden 24 timer etter at spilleren og klanlederen er advart. Gullbarrer har null verdi for deg personlig, men Kongen og Palasset kan bruke dem til å aktivere bonuser for hele kongeriket. Hvis vi har gullbarrer, brukes de til fordel for K273.</li>

        <h3>6. Medlemmer av det aktede kongeriket</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Hver spiller må følge disse reglene for å være beskyttet av ROE. Spillere som ikke er beskyttet er:
                <ul>
                    <li>FREDLØSE</li>
                    <li>KLANLØSE SPILLERE (de fleste)</li>
                    <li>IKKE-ROE MEDLEMMER</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Beskyttede klanløse spillere: Alle spillere på eller under 100k might er beskyttet og skal ikke angripes fritt. Interaksjoner med klanløse spillere bør først være å lære om dem og deres mål i spillet, etterfulgt av oppfordring til å bli med i en klan. Frem dyrking i spillet og spill for kongeriket fremfor personlig belønning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Fredløs-status</strong></p>
        <p>Myndigheten til å erklære en borger eller en klan fredløs, eller å oppheve en eksisterende fredløs-status, ligger utelukkende hos følgende myndigheter i Kongeriket:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Kongen, øverste beskytter av orden og rettferdighet.</li>
            <li>Kongens høyre hånd, som fungerer som den direkte representanten for kongelig myndighet.</li>
            <li>Dronningen, som medinnehaver av den kongelige myndigheten.</li>
            <li>Hoveddommeren i Kongerikets tribunal, i kraft av sin rolle som rettferdighetens vokter.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ingen annen aktør i Kongeriket kan, uten et uttrykkelig mandat gitt av en av disse myndighetene, erklære en borger eller en klan fredløs. Enhver erklæring utstedt av en uautorisert aktør er ugyldig.</p>
        <p><strong>Den Kongelige Garden</strong></p>
        <p>Den Kongelige Garden består av mange klaner og har spillere på ulike nivåer som medlemmer. RG-oppgavene vil fortsette sine normale oppgaver som skatteinnkreving og håndheving for Palasset. De vil også fungere som en elitehær og en patrulje- og forsvarsenhet for kongeriket/territoriet. De er spydspissen for kongeriket og er her for å hjelpe klaner som har problemer med spillere og fredløse.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones (CoT)</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Under eventet kan du speide og angripe byer under følgende betingelser:</li>
            <li>Ingen klanfort-angrep: Angrep på en annen klans forter eller bygninger er strengt forbudt.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Ressurshåndtering</strong></p>
        <p>Hold ressursene lave under eventet for å unngå tyveri; send tropper til forter om nødvendig. Praktiser No Value City (NVC).</p>
        <p><strong>"Fair Play"</strong></p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>50 %-regelen gjelder.</li>
            <li>Hvis du blir angrepet, uansett deres might, har du lov til å angripe hvem som helst tilbake. Det betyr at hvis en spiller med 1,000,000 might angriper en spiller med 50,000,000 might, har 50,000,000-might-spilleren full rett til å angripe tilbake hvis de ønsker.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>8. Konfliktløsningsprosess</h3>
        <p>Når ROE brytes, bør følgende trinn tas:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Kontakt den andre spilleren for å forsøke å løse saken. Hvis ingen løsning innen 24 timer, eskaler til din klan-diplomat.</li>
            <li>Hvis ingen løsning oppnås mellom klan-diplomater, kan de bringe saken inn for domstolen ved å poste den i #K273/CLAIMS. Kun klanledere eller diplomater har lov til å poste krav i denne chatten.</li>
            <li>Dommerne vil avgjøre skyldig part (om noen) og en akseptabel kompensasjon.</li>
            <li>Hvis den skyldige parten (eller deres klan) nekter å kompensere, vil Archon eller hoveddommer avgjøre om spilleren eller klanen skal erklæres fredløs, og Den Kongelige Garden settes i beredskap.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

            <li>Städte mit über 3 Tagen angesammelten Barren können 24 Stunden nach Warnung des Spielers und Clanführers von einem Mitglied der Königlichen Garde angegriffen werden. Goldbarren haben für dich persönlich keinen Wert, aber der König und der Palast können sie verwenden, um Boni für das ganze Königreich zu aktivieren.

        <h3>6. Mitglieder des geschätzten Königreichs</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Jeder Spieler muss diese Regeln einhalten, um durch das ROE geschützt zu sein. Spieler, die nicht geschützt sind:
                <ul>
                    <li>GEÄCHTETE</li>
                    <li>CLANLOSE SPIELER (die meisten)</li>
                    <li>NICHT-ROE-MITGLIEDER</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Geschützte clanlose Spieler: Alle Spieler mit oder unter 100k Might sind geschützt und dürfen nicht frei angegriffen werden. Interaktionen mit clanlosen Spielern sollten zuerst dazu dienen, sie und ihre Ziele im Spiel kennenzulernen, gefolgt von der Ermutigung, einem Clan beizutreten. Fördert Wachstum im Spiel und spielt für das Königreich statt für persönliche Belohnung.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Status als Geächteter</strong></p>
        <p>Die Befugnis, einen Bürger oder einen Clan zum Geächteten zu erklären oder einen bestehenden Geächtetenstatus zu widerrufen, liegt ausschließlich bei den folgenden Mächten des Königreichs:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Der König, oberster Hüter von Ordnung und Gerechtigkeit.</li>
            <li>Die Hand des Königs, als direkter Vertreter der königlichen Autorität.</li>
            <li>Die Königin, als Mitträgerin der königlichen Autorität.</li>
            <li>Der Oberste Richter des Königreichstribunals, kraft seines Amtes als Hüter der Gerechtigkeit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Kein anderer Akteur des Königreichs darf ohne ein ausdrückliches Mandat einer dieser Autoritäten einen Bürger oder einen Clan zum Geächteten erklären. Jede von einer nicht autorisierten Stelle ausgesprochene Erklärung ist null und nichtig.</p>
        <p><strong>Königliche Garde</strong></p>
        <p>Die Königliche Garde besteht aus vielen Clans und hat Mitglieder verschiedener Spielerlevel. Die Aufgaben der RG werden ihre normalen Aufgaben wie Steuererhebung und Durchsetzung für den Palast fortsetzen. Sie werden außerdem als Elitearmee sowie als Patrouillen- und Verteidigungseinheit des Königreichs/Territoriums dienen. Sie sind die Spitze des Speers für das Königreich und sind hier, um Clans zu unterstützen, die Probleme mit Spielern und Geächteten haben.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones CoT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Währenddessen kannst du Städte unter folgenden Bedingungen ausspähen und angreifen:</li>
            <li>Keine Clan-Festungsangriffe: Angriffe auf die Festungen oder Gebäude eines anderen Clans sind strikt verboten.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Ressourcenmanagement</strong></p>
        <p>Halte Ressourcen während des Events niedrig, um Diebstahl zu vermeiden; sende Truppen zu Festungen, wenn nötig. Übe No Value City (NVC).</p>
        <p><strong>"Fair Play"</strong></p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Die 50%-Regel gilt.</li>
            <li>Wenn du angegriffen wirst, unabhängig von deren Might, darfst du jeden zurückangreifen. Das heißt, wenn ein Spieler mit 1.000.000 Might einen Spieler mit 50.000.000 Might angreift, hat der Spieler mit 50.000.000 Might das volle Recht, zurückzugreifen, wenn er möchte.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>8. Konfliktlösungsprozess</h3>
        <p>Wenn das ROE verletzt wird, sollten folgende Schritte unternommen werden:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Kontaktiere den anderen Spieler, um eine Lösung zu finden. Wenn innerhalb von 24 Stunden keine Lösung, eskaliere an deinen Clan-Diplomaten.</li>
            <li>Wenn zwischen Clan-Diplomaten keine Lösung erzielt wird, können sie das Thema vor das Gericht bringen, indem sie es in #K273/CLAIMS posten. Nur Clanführer oder Diplomaten dürfen in diesem Chat Ansprüche posten.</li>
            <li>Die Richter werden entscheiden, wer (falls vorhanden) schuldig ist und eine akzeptable Entschädigungssumme festlegen.</li>
            <li>Wenn die schuldige Partei (oder ihr Clan) sich weigert zu entschädigen, bestimmen der Archon oder der Oberste Richter, ob der Spieler oder Clan zum Geächteten erklärt werden soll, und die Königliche Garde wird in Bereitschaft versetzt.</li>
        </ul>

<p class="roe-intro">Por orden del Rey Arihelm, el siguiente ROE está en vigor para el reino:</p>
<ol class="roe-list">
    <li>
        <h3>Acuerdo general de jugadores K273</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>El reino K273 sigue el acuerdo IKFPA establecido durante el reinado del Rey Arcadia y espera que cada miembro lo cumpla en consecuencia, especialmente después de la apertura del reino.</li>
            <li>El ROE es efectivo de inmediato y puede ser enmendado.</li>
            <li>Cada enmienda tendrá un margen de 24 horas para que otros puedan adaptarse a través de diferentes zonas horarias.</li>
            <li>Por favor, respeta a todos con quienes te encuentres.</li>
            <li>Existe una política de tolerancia cero contra lenguaje racista, de odio, denigrante o amenazante.</li>
            <li>Las violaciones pueden ser reportadas al Rey/Reina o a la Mano del Rey.</li>
            <li>Se les puede asignar un título negativo y/o estatus de forajido.</li>
            <li>Las amenazas se toman muy en serio, al igual que el acoso, ya que van en contra de las reglas del Código de Conducta de TOTAL BATTLE. El chat del reino es un lugar para que todos se sientan bienvenidos.</li>
            <li>El reino se considera pacífico en todo momento.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Reglas del Acuerdo de Juego Limpio Inter-Reinos (IKFPA)</h3>
        <p>Estos son acuerdos generales entre distintos reinos para cuando K273 abra. No son reglas estrictas pero se anima a los reinos a cumplirlas.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sin discurso de odio.</li>
            <li>No ataques a edificios de clan, portales conmemorativos o jugadores por debajo de 100K de poder.</li>
            <li>Todas las casillas RSS están protegidas de ataques excepto durante eventos PvP. Los eventos PvP son: CoT, KvK, War Tools, Gold / Silver Rush, War Games, Lava Trials (NO incluye Ruthless Slaughter específicamente).</li>
            <li>Los ataques a fuertes en otros reinos implican estatus inmediato de forajido según el ROE del reino.</li>
            <li>La compensación por violaciones se acuerda dentro de 48 horas (IKFPA no es aplicado por una sola entidad).</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Funcionarios del Reino - El Palacio</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>El Palacio es responsable de mantener el honor, la integridad y la paz dentro de K273 y con otros reinos.</li>
            <li>El Rey es elegido para representar a los ciudadanos de K273 y presidir el palacio.</li>
            <li>La Reina y la Mano del Rey son responsables de coordinar los asuntos del reino y pueden hablar en nombre del Rey en su ausencia.</li>
            <li>El Rey, la Reina y la Mano del Rey son responsables de la gestión del tesoro en nombre de los jugadores del reino.</li>
            <li>La Reina y la Mano del Rey deben ser de clanes diferentes.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Obligaciones de los líderes de clan</h3>
        <p>Todos los líderes de clan deben cumplir sus obligaciones como líderes:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Respetar el ROE (Rules of Engagement).</li>
            <li>Asegurar que sus miembros respeten y sigan el ROE.</li>
            <li>Educar a sus miembros para apoyar el crecimiento y la unidad del reino.</li>
            <li>Un líder que falle en estos compromisos será declarado forajido. &gt;=D</li>
            <li>Los líderes son el ejemplo y el estándar del reino, y sus acciones marcan el camino para que todos los miembros lo sigan.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>1. TIEMPO DE PAZ</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Los ataques a ciudades están prohibidos excepto durante CoT y los intercambios de CP planificados.</li>
            <li>Los ataques a edificios de clan están prohibidos.</li>
            <li>Portales en tiempo de paz: Nada de tocar ni boop boops salvo en CoT. Esto significa que no se pueden atacar portales en ningún lugar a menos que se demuestre que son hostiles. Los portales hostiles incluyen ataques a edificios de clan, miembros y todos los recursos del juego (incluidos los recursos de eventos de temporada). No se permite atacar portales en territorios del clan para actividades del clan a menos que sean hostiles.</li>
            <li>Reglas de portales en CoT: Sin restricciones.</li>
            <li>El scouting es una forma de agresión y es ilegal durante el tiempo de paz.</li>
            <li>Si eres atacado, independientemente de su poder, tienes permitido atacar de vuelta a cualquiera en cualquier momento. Es decir, si un jugador de 1,000,000 de poder ataca a un jugador de 50,000,000 de poder, el jugador de 50,000,000 de poder tiene pleno derecho a contraatacar si así lo desea.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>2. CLANES &amp; DIPLOMÁTICOS</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Los clanes deberían indicar "We abide by K273 ROE" para ser atendidos por el reino y protegidos por el ROE.</li>
            <li>Los clanes deben identificar al menos un diplomático en la parte superior de la descripción del clan que pueda ayudar con la resolución de disputas. Los diplomáticos deben ser un líder o superior activo.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>3. Reglas generales</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Todos los edificios de recursos dentro del territorio del clan pertenecen a ese clan. Esto incluye recursos de eventos de temporada.</li>
            <li>Los recursos creados por jugadores pertenecen al individuo que los creó a menos que se acuerde compartir entre dos partes.</li>
            <li>Las criptas raras pertenecen al individuo que las desbloqueó.</li>
            <li>WS y DMs:
                <ul>
                    <li>a. No existe un sistema de registro. Todos los edificios de recursos salvajes (incluidos DM/WS) son por orden de llegada (FCFS).</li>
                    <li>c. No se pueden hacer reclamos si eres scouteado/atacado en recursos salvajes a menos que
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pierdas el recurso.</li>
                            <li>Seas scouteado/atacado y luego atacado de nuevo. (regla 2x)</li>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>4. GUÍA DE COMPENSACIÓN DEL PALACIO</h3>
        <p>Por favor consulta k273tb.xyz para el calculador de compensación.</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Cada ataque ilegal o scouting ilegal conlleva un costo base de 1 millón de plata. Cualquier pérdida adicional, daño o recursos robados se agregan encima de este costo base.</li>
            <li>RSS: cantidad igual a la cantidad robada</li>
            <li>Oro: 1 Oro = 3,000 Plata o minas de oro iguales a lo robado + 10% (por decisión de la víctima)</li>
            <li>Alquitrán: 1 Alquitrán = 1,000 Plata</li>
            <li>Barras de oro = sin compensación</li>
            <li>Portal cerrado ilegalmente: 1M de plata (+1M por el ataque ilegal en sí)</li>
            <li>El daño se calcula según la siguiente fórmula: El daño de las tropas perdidas se calcula según la siguiente fórmula:
                <ul>
                    <li>Héroe = 1.5k</li>
                    <li>Capitán = 1k</li>

                    <li>Grifos = Nivel de tropas x 800</li>
                    <li>Catapultas, Murallas = Nivel de murallas x 200</li>
                    <li>Monstruos III-VII (Nivel de monstruo - 2) x 1.3k</li>
                    <li>Monstruos I &amp; II = x 8.64k</li>
                    <li>Guardia mercenaria = Nivel de tropas x 120</li>

                    <li>Ataque sin destruir = 10 millones de plata</li>
                    <li>Ataque y destrucción = 20 millones de cada Plata, Hierro, Madera, Piedra</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>5. IMPUESTOS</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Las ciudades con más de 3 días de lingotes acumulados pueden ser atacadas por un miembro de la Guardia Real 24 horas después de advertir al jugador y al líder del clan. Los lingotes de oro no tienen valor para ti personalmente, pero el Rey y el Palacio pueden usarlos para activar bonificaciones para todo el reino. Si tenemos las barras de oro, se usarán en beneficio de K273.</li>
            <li>Máximo de lingotes de oro por ciudad:
                <ul>
                    <li>Ciudad 1-9: 2000 Lingotes</li>

        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Todos los jugadores deben cumplir estas reglas para estar protegidos por el ROE. Los jugadores que no están protegidos son:
                <ul>
                    <li>FORAJIDOS</li>
                    <li>JUGADORES SIN CLAN (la mayoría)</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Jugadores sin clan protegidos: Todos los jugadores con 100k de poder o menos están protegidos y no deben ser atacados libremente. Las interacciones con jugadores sin clan deberían comenzar por conocerlos y sus objetivos en el juego, seguidas de alentarles a unirse a un clan. Fomenta el crecimiento en el juego y juega por el reino en lugar de la recompensa personal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Estatus de forajido</strong></p>
        <p>La autoridad para declarar a un ciudadano o a un clan forajido, o para revocar un estatus de forajido existente, recae exclusivamente en los siguientes poderes del Reino:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>El Rey, guardián supremo del orden y la justicia.</li>
            <li>La Mano del Rey, actuando como representante directo de la autoridad real.</li>
            <li>La Reina, como coportadora de la autoridad real.</li>
            <li>El Juez Principal del Tribunal del Reino, por su papel como guardián de la justicia.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ningún otro actor del Reino puede, sin un mandato explícito otorgado por una de estas autoridades, declarar forajido a un ciudadano o a un clan. Cualquier declaración emitida por un actor no autorizado será nula y sin efecto.</p>
        <p><strong>Guardia Real</strong></p>
        <p>La Guardia Real está compuesta por muchos clanes y tiene miembros de distintos niveles de jugadores. Las tareas de la RG continuarán con sus funciones normales como la recaudación de impuestos y la aplicación para el Palacio. También actuarán como un ejército de élite y una unidad de patrulla y defensa del reino/territorio. Son la punta de lanza del reino y están aquí para ayudar a los clanes con problemas con jugadores y forajidos.</p>

        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones CoT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Durante, puedes scoutear y atacar ciudades bajo las siguientes condiciones:</li>
            <li>Sin ataques a fuertes de clan: Atacar los fuertes o edificios de otro clan está estrictamente prohibido.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Gestión de recursos</strong></p>
        <p>Mantén los recursos bajos durante el evento para evitar robos; envía tropas a fortalezas si es necesario. Practica No Value City (NVC).</p>
        <p><strong>"Fair Play"</strong></p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Se aplica la regla del 50%.</li>
            <li>Si eres atacado, independientemente de su poder, tienes permitido atacar de vuelta a cualquiera. Es decir, si un jugador de 1,000,000 de poder ataca a un jugador de 50,000,000 de poder, el jugador de 50,000,000 de poder tiene pleno derecho a contraatacar si así lo desea.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>8. Proceso de resolución de conflictos</h3>
        <p>Cuando se viola el ROE, se deben seguir los siguientes pasos:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Contacta al otro jugador para intentar resolver. Si no hay resolución dentro de 24 horas, eleva a tu diplomático de clan.</li>
            <li>Si no se llega a una resolución entre diplomáticos de clan, pueden llevar el asunto ante la Corte publicándolo en #K273/CLAIMS. Solo líderes de clan o diplomáticos pueden publicar reclamaciones en este chat.</li>
            <li>Los jueces dictaminarán para definir a la parte culpable (si la hay) y una cantidad aceptable de compensación.</li>
            <li>Si la parte culpable (o su clan) se niega a compensar, el Arconte o el Juez Principal determinará si el jugador o clan debe ser declarado forajido y la Guardia Real se activará en espera.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

        <h3>Accord general des joueurs K273</h3>

            <li>Le ROE est effectif immediatement et peut etre amende.</li>

        </ol>
    </li>

            <li>Former leurs membres afin de soutenir la croissance et l'unite du royaume.</li>
            <li>Un chef qui echoue a ces engagements sera declare hors-la-loi. &gt;=D</li>
            <li>Les chefs sont l'exemple et la norme du royaume, et leurs actions tracent la voie pour tous les membres.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Veuillez consulter k273tb.xyz pour le calculateur de compensation.</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Chaque attaque illegale ou scouting illegal entraine un cout de base de 1 million d'argent. Toute perte supplementaire, dommage ou ressource volee s'ajoute a ce cout de base.</li>
            <li>RSS: montant egal au montant vole</li>
            <li>Or: 1 Or = 3,000 Argent ou mines d'or egales au vole + 10% (selon la decision de la victime)</li>
            <li>Goudron: 1 Goudron = 1,000 Argent</li>
            <li>Barres d'or = aucune compensation</li>
            <li>Portail ferme illegalement: 1M d'argent (+1M pour l'attaque illegale elle-meme)</li>

            <li>Chaque joueur doit respecter ces regles pour etre protege par le ROE. Les joueurs non proteges sont:
                <ul>
                    <li>HORS-LA-LOI</li>
                    <li>JOUEURS SANS CLAN (la plupart)</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Joueurs sans clan proteges: Tous les joueurs a 100k de puissance ou moins sont proteges et ne doivent pas etre attaques librement. Les interactions avec les joueurs sans clan devraient d'abord servir a les connaitre et a comprendre leurs objectifs dans le jeu, puis a les encourager a rejoindre un clan. Favorisez la croissance dans le jeu et jouez pour le royaume plutot que pour la recompense personnelle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Statut de hors-la-loi</strong></p>
        <p>L'autorite de declarer un citoyen ou un clan hors-la-loi, ou de revoquer un statut de hors-la-loi existant, revient exclusivement aux pouvoirs suivants du Royaume:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Le Roi, gardien supreme de l'ordre et de la justice.</li>
            <li>La Main du Roi, agissant comme le representant direct de l'autorite royale.</li>

            <li>Le Juge en chef du Tribunal du Royaume, en vertu de son role de gardien de la justice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Aucun autre acteur du Royaume ne peut, sans un mandat explicite accorde par l'une de ces autorites, declarer un citoyen ou un clan hors-la-loi. Toute declaration emise par un acteur non autorise est nulle et sans effet.</p>
        <p><strong>Garde Royale</strong></p>
        <p>La Garde Royale est composee de nombreux clans et comprend des membres de differents niveaux de joueurs. Les taches de la RG continueront avec ses missions normales comme la collecte des taxes et l'application pour le Palais. Elle agira egalement comme une armee d'elite et une unite de patrouille et de defense du royaume/territoire. Elle est la pointe de la lance pour le royaume et est la pour aider les clans ayant des problemes avec des joueurs et des hors-la-loi.</p>

            <li>Aucune attaque de fort de clan: Attaquer les forts ou batiments d'un autre clan est strictement interdit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Gestion des ressources</strong></p>

    <li>
        <h3>8. Processus de resolution des conflits</h3>
        <p>Lorsque le ROE est viole, les etapes suivantes doivent etre suivies:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Contactez l'autre joueur pour tenter de resoudre. Si aucune resolution dans les 24 heures, passez a votre diplomate de clan.</li>
            <li>Si aucune resolution n'est atteinte entre diplomates de clan, ils peuvent porter l'affaire devant la Cour en la publiant dans #K273/CLAIMS. Seuls les chefs de clan ou diplomates sont autorises a poster des reclamations dans ce chat.</li>
            <li>Les juges trancheront pour definir la partie coupable (le cas echeant) et un montant de compensation acceptable.</li>
            <li>Si la partie coupable (ou son clan) refuse de compenser, l'Archonte ou le Juge en chef determinera si le joueur ou le clan doit etre declare hors-la-loi et la Garde Royale sera activee en attente.</li>

<p class="roe-intro">Per ordine del Re Arihelm, il seguente ROE è in vigore per il regno:</p>
<ol class="roe-list">
    <li>
        <h3>Accordo generale dei giocatori K273</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Il regno K273 segue l'accordo IKFPA stabilito durante il regno di Re Arcadia e si aspetta che ogni membro lo rispetti, soprattutto dopo l'apertura del regno.</li>
            <li>Il ROE è in vigore immediatamente e può essere modificato.</li>
            <li>Ogni modifica avrà un periodo di 24 ore in modo che gli altri possano adattarsi ai vari fusi orari.</li>
            <li>Si prega di rispettare tutti coloro con cui si entra in contatto.</li>
            <li>C'è una politica di tolleranza zero contro linguaggio razzista, odioso, denigratorio o minaccioso.</li>
            <li>Le violazioni possono essere segnalate al Re/Regina o alla Mano del Re.</li>
            <li>Potrebbe essere assegnato un titolo negativo e/o lo status di fuorilegge.</li>
            <li>Le minacce sono prese molto seriamente, così come il bullismo, poiché sono contro le regole del Codice di Condotta di TOTAL BATTLE. La chat del regno è un luogo in cui tutti devono sentirsi benvenuti.</li>
            <li>Il regno è considerato pacifico in ogni momento.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Regole dell'Accordo di Fair Play Inter-Regno (IKFPA)</h3>
        <p>Questi sono accordi generali tra diversi regni per quando K273 apre. Non sono regole rigide ma i regni sono incoraggiati a rispettarle.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Nessun linguaggio d'odio.</li>
            <li>Nessun attacco a edifici del clan, portali memoriali o giocatori sotto 100K di might.</li>
            <li>Tutte le caselle RSS sono protette dagli attacchi tranne durante gli eventi PvP. Gli eventi PvP sono: CoT, KvK, War Tools, Gold / Silver Rush, War Games, Lava Trials (non include specificamente Ruthless Slaughter).</li>
            <li>Gli attacchi ai forti in altri regni comportano la dichiarazione immediata di fuorilegge secondo il ROE del regno.</li>
            <li>La compensazione per le violazioni deve essere concordata entro 48 ore (l'IKFPA non è applicato da una singola entità).</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Funzionari del regno - Il Palazzo</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Il Palazzo è responsabile di mantenere onore, integrità e pace all'interno di K273 e con gli altri regni.</li>
            <li>Il Re è eletto per rappresentare i cittadini di K273 e presiedere il palazzo.</li>
            <li>La Regina e la Mano del Re sono responsabili di coordinare gli affari del regno e possono parlare a nome del Re in sua assenza.</li>
            <li>Il Re, la Regina e la Mano del Re sono responsabili della gestione del tesoro per conto dei giocatori del regno.</li>
            <li>La Regina e la Mano del Re devono provenire da clan diversi.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Obblighi dei leader di clan</h3>
        <p>Tutti i leader di clan devono adempiere ai loro obblighi come leader:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Rispettare il ROE (Rules of Engagement).</li>
            <li>Assicurare che i loro membri rispettino e seguano il ROE.</li>
            <li>Educare i loro membri per supportare la crescita e l'unità del regno.</li>
            <li>Un leader che non rispetta questi impegni sarà dichiarato Fuorilegge. &gt;=D</li>
            <li>I leader sono l'esempio e lo standard del regno, e le loro azioni tracciano la strada da seguire per tutti i membri.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>1. TEMPO DI PACE</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Gli attacchi alle città sono vietati tranne durante CoT e gli scambi CP pianificati.</li>
            <li>Gli attacchi agli edifici del clan sono proibiti.</li>
            <li>Portali in tempo di pace: niente tocchi o boop boops salvo durante CoT. Questo significa nessun attacco a portali ovunque a meno che non siano dimostrati ostili. I portali ostili includono attacchi agli edifici del clan, ai membri e a tutte le risorse di gioco (incluse le risorse degli eventi stagionali). Attaccare portali nei territori del clan per attività di clan non è consentito a meno che non siano ostili.</li>
            <li>Regole portali CoT: nessuna restrizione.</li>
            <li>Lo scouting è una forma di aggressione ed è illegale durante il tempo di pace.</li>
            <li>Se vieni attaccato, indipendentemente dal loro might, ti è consentito attaccare chiunque in risposta in qualsiasi momento. Significa che, se un giocatore con 1,000,000 di might attacca un giocatore con 50,000,000 di might, il giocatore con 50,000,000 di might ha pieno diritto di attaccare in risposta se lo desidera.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>2. CLAN &amp; DIPLOMATICI</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>I clan dovrebbero indicare "We abide by K273 ROE" per essere serviti dal regno e protetti dal ROE.</li>
            <li>I clan devono identificare almeno un diplomatico in cima alla descrizione del clan che possa aiutare nella risoluzione delle dispute. I diplomatici devono essere un leader attivo o superiore.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>3. Regole generali</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Tutti gli edifici di risorse all'interno del territorio del clan appartengono a quel clan. Questo include le risorse degli eventi stagionali.</li>
            <li>Le risorse create dai giocatori appartengono all'individuo che le ha create, a meno che non si concordi di condividere tra due parti.</li>
            <li>Le cripte rare appartengono all'individuo che le ha sbloccate.</li>
            <li>WS e DMs:
                <ul>
                    <li>a. Non esiste un sistema di registrazione. Tutti gli edifici di risorse selvatiche (inclusi DM/WS) sono first come, first serve (FCFS).</li>
                    <li>c. Non si possono fare richieste se vieni scoutato/attaccato nelle risorse selvatiche a meno che
                        <ul>
                            <li>Perdi la risorsa.</li>
                            <li>Vieni scoutato/attaccato e poi attaccato di nuovo. (regola 2x)</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>d. È tua responsabilità inviare un messaggio al tuo diplomatico, all'altro giocatore e al diplomatico/capo clan avversario se qualcuno ti sta scoutando o attaccando in una miniera.</li>

            </li>
        </ul>

    <li>
        <h3>4. GUIDA ALLA COMPENSAZIONE DEL PALAZZO</h3>
        <p>Si prega di vedere k273tb.xyz per il calcolatore di compensazione.</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Ogni attacco o scouting illegale comporta un costo base di 1 milione di argento. Eventuali perdite aggiuntive, danni o risorse rubate si aggiungono a questo costo base.</li>
            <li>RSS: importo pari alla quantità rubata</li>
            <li>Oro: 1 Oro = 3,000 Argento o miniere d'oro pari al rubato + 10% (a decisione della vittima)</li>
            <li>Catrame: 1 Catrame = 1,000 Argento</li>
            <li>Lingotti d'oro = nessuna compensazione</li>
            <li>Portale chiuso illegalmente: 1M argento (+1M per l'attacco illegale stesso)</li>
            <li>Il danno è calcolato secondo la seguente formula: I danni delle truppe perse sono calcolati secondo la seguente formula:
                <ul>
                    <li>Eroe = 1.5k</li>
                    <li>Capitano = 1k</li>

                    <li>Attaccare e distruggere = 20 milioni di ciascuno Argento, Ferro, Legno, Pietra</li>

        <h3>5. TASSE</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Le città con oltre 3 giorni di lingotti accumulati possono essere attaccate da un membro della Guardia Reale 24 ore dopo aver avvisato il giocatore e il leader del clan. I lingotti d'oro non hanno alcun valore personale per te, ma il Re e il Palazzo possono usarli per attivare bonus per tutto il regno. Se abbiamo i lingotti d'oro, saranno usati a beneficio di K273.</li>
            <li>Numero massimo di lingotti d'oro per città:
                <ul>
                    <li>Città 1-9: 2000 Lingotti</li>
                    <li>Città 10-19: 3000 Lingotti</li>
                    <li>Città 20-24: 10000 Lingotti</li>
                    <li>Città 25-29: 35000 Lingotti</li>
                    <li>Città 30-34: 60000 Lingotti</li>
                    <li>Città 35-39: 70000 Lingotti</li>
                    <li>Città 40+: 90000 Lingotti</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>6. Membri del Regno Stimato</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Ogni giocatore deve rispettare queste regole per essere protetto dal ROE. I giocatori non protetti sono:
                <ul>
                    <li>FUORILEGGE</li>
                    <li>GIOCATORI SENZA CLAN (la maggior parte)</li>
                    <li>NON MEMBRI ROE</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Giocatori senza clan protetti: Tutti i giocatori con 100k di might o meno sono protetti e non devono essere attaccati liberamente. Le interazioni con i giocatori senza clan dovrebbero prima servire a conoscerli e i loro obiettivi nel gioco, seguite dall'incoraggiamento a unirsi a un clan. Favorire la crescita nel gioco e giocare per il regno anziché per la ricompensa personale.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Status di fuorilegge</strong></p>
        <p>L'autorità di dichiarare un cittadino o un clan Fuorilegge, o di revocare uno status di fuorilegge esistente, spetta esclusivamente ai seguenti poteri del Regno:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Il Re, supremo guardiano dell'ordine e della giustizia.</li>
            <li>La Mano del Re, che agisce come rappresentante diretto dell'autorità reale.</li>
            <li>La Regina, come co-titolare dell'autorità reale.</li>
            <li>Il Giudice Capo del Tribunale del Regno, in virtù del suo ruolo di custode della giustizia.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nessun altro attore del Regno può, senza un mandato esplicito concesso da una di queste autorità, dichiarare un cittadino o un clan fuorilegge. Qualsiasi dichiarazione emessa da un attore non autorizzato sarà nulla e priva di effetto.</p>
        <p><strong>Guardia Reale</strong></p>
        <p>La Guardia Reale è composta da molti clan e ha giocatori di vari livelli come membri. I doveri della RG continueranno i loro compiti normali come la riscossione delle tasse e l'applicazione delle regole del Palazzo. Agiranno anche come un esercito d'élite e unità di pattuglia e difesa del regno/territorio. Sono la punta della lancia per il regno e sono qui per assistere i clan che hanno problemi con giocatori e fuorilegge.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones CoT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Durante, puoi fare scouting e attaccare città alle seguenti condizioni:</li>
            <li>Nessun attacco ai forti del clan: attaccare i forti o gli edifici di un altro clan è severamente proibito.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Gestione delle risorse</strong></p>
        <p>Mantieni le risorse basse durante l'evento per evitare furti; invia truppe ai forti se necessario. Pratica No Value City (NVC).</p>
        <p><strong>"Fair Play"</strong></p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Si applica la regola del 50%.</li>
            <li>Se vieni attaccato, indipendentemente dal loro might, ti è consentito attaccare chiunque in risposta. Significa che, se un giocatore con 1,000,000 di might attacca un giocatore con 50,000,000 di might, il giocatore con 50,000,000 di might ha pieno diritto di attaccare in risposta se lo desidera.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>8. Processo di risoluzione dei conflitti</h3>
        <p>Quando il ROE viene violato, devono essere seguiti i seguenti passaggi:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Contatta l'altro giocatore per tentare di risolvere. Se non c'è risoluzione entro 24 ore, rivolgiti al tuo diplomatico di clan.</li>
            <li>Se non si raggiunge una risoluzione tra diplomatici di clan, possono portare la questione davanti alla Corte pubblicandola in #K273/CLAIMS. Solo i leader di clan o i diplomatici sono autorizzati a postare richieste in questa chat.</li>
            <li>I giudici giudicheranno per definire la parte colpevole (se presente) e un importo di compensazione accettabile.</li>
            <li>Se la parte colpevole (o il suo clan) rifiuta di compensare, l'Arconte o il Giudice Capo determinerà se il giocatore o il clan deve essere dichiarato fuorilegge e la Guardia Reale sarà attivata in stand-by.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

            <li>O reino é considerado pacífico em todos os momentos.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Regras do Acordo de Jogo Justo Inter-Reinos (IKFPA)</h3>

        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>O Palácio é responsável por manter honra, integridade e paz dentro de K273 e com outros reinos.</li>
            <li>O Rei é eleito para representar os cidadãos de K273 e presidir o palácio.</li>

            <li>Um líder que falhar nesses compromissos será declarado Fora da Lei. &gt;=D</li>
            <li>Os líderes são o exemplo e o padrão do reino, e suas ações definem o caminho para todos os membros seguirem.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>1. TEMPO DE PAZ</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Ataques a cidades são proibidos exceto durante CoT e trocas de CP planejadas.</li>
            <li>Ataques a edifícios de clã são proibidos.</li>
            <li>Portais em tempo de paz: nada de tocar ou boop boops salvo no CoT. Isso significa nenhum ataque a portais em lugar algum a menos que sejam comprovadamente hostis. Portais hostis incluem ataques a edifícios do clã, membros e todos os recursos do jogo (incluindo recursos de eventos sazonais). Atacar portais em territórios de clã para atividades de clã não é permitido, a menos que sejam hostis.</li>
            <li>Regras de Portais CoT: Sem restrições.</li>
            <li>Scouting é uma forma de agressão e é ilegal durante o tempo de paz.</li>
            <li>Se você for atacado, independentemente do seu might, você pode atacar qualquer um de volta a qualquer momento. Isso significa que, se um jogador com 1,000,000 de might atacar um jogador com 50,000,000 de might, o jogador com 50,000,000 de might tem total direito de atacar de volta se desejar.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>2. CLÃS &amp; DIPLOMATAS</h3>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>3. Regras gerais</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Todos os edifícios de recursos dentro do território do clã pertencem a esse clã. Isso inclui recursos de eventos sazonais.</li>

            <li>Criptas raras pertencem ao indivíduo que as desbloqueou.</li>
            <li>WS e DMs:
                <ul>
                    <li>a. Não há sistema de registro. Todos os edifícios de recursos selvagens (incluindo DM/WS) são por ordem de chegada (FCFS).</li>
                    <li>c. Reivindicações não podem ser feitas se você for scoutado/atacado em recursos selvagens a menos que
                        <ul>
                            <li>Você perca o recurso.</li>
                            <li>Você seja scoutado/atacado e depois atacado novamente. (regra 2x)</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>d. É sua responsabilidade enviar mensagem ao seu diplomata, ao outro jogador e ao diplomata/líder de clã adversário se alguém estiver scouteando você ou atacando você em uma mina.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. GUIA DE COMPENSAÇÃO DO PALÁCIO</h3>
        <p>Por favor, consulte k273tb.xyz para o calculador de compensação.</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Todo ataque ou scouting ilegal tem um custo base de 1 milhão de prata. Quaisquer perdas adicionais, danos ou recursos roubados são adicionados a esse custo base.</li>
            <li>RSS: valor igual ao valor roubado</li>
            <li>Ouro: 1 Ouro = 3,000 Prata ou minas de ouro iguais ao roubado + 10% (por decisão da vítima)</li>
            <li>Alcatrão: 1 Alcatrão = 1,000 Prata</li>

        <h3>5. TAXAS</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Cidades com mais de 3 dias de lingotes acumulados podem ser atacadas por um membro da Guarda Real 24 horas após avisar o jogador e o líder do clã. Lingotes de ouro não têm valor para você pessoalmente, mas o Rei e o Palácio podem usá-los para ativar bônus para todo o reino. Se tivermos as barras de ouro, elas serão usadas para o benefício de K273.</li>
            <li>Máximo de lingotes de ouro por cidade:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cidade 1-9: 2000 Lingotes</li>
                    <li>Cidade 10-19: 3000 Lingotes</li>
                    <li>Cidade 20-24: 10000 Lingotes</li>

    <li>
        <h3>6. Membros do Reino Estimado</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Todo jogador deve cumprir essas regras para ser protegido pelo ROE. Jogadores não protegidos são:
                <ul>
                    <li>FORAS DA LEI</li>
                    <li>JOGADORES SEM CLÃ (a maioria)</li>
                    <li>NÃO MEMBROS DO ROE</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Jogadores sem clã protegidos: Todos os jogadores com 100k de might ou menos são protegidos e não devem ser atacados livremente. Interações com jogadores sem clã devem primeiro ser para conhecê-los e seus objetivos no jogo, seguidas de incentivo para entrar em um clã. Incentive o crescimento no jogo e jogue pelo reino em vez de recompensa pessoal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Status de fora da lei</strong></p>
        <p>A autoridade para declarar um cidadão ou um clã fora da lei, ou revogar um status de fora da lei existente, cabe exclusivamente aos seguintes poderes do Reino:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>O Rei, guardião supremo da ordem e da justiça.</li>
            <li>A Mão do Rei, atuando como representante direto da autoridade real.</li>
            <li>A Rainha, como co-titular da autoridade real.</li>
            <li>O Juiz Chefe do Tribunal do Reino, em virtude de seu papel como guardião da justiça.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nenhum outro ator do Reino pode, sem um mandato explícito concedido por uma dessas autoridades, declarar um cidadão ou um clã fora da lei. Qualquer declaração emitida por um ator não autorizado será nula e sem efeito.</p>
        <p><strong>Guarda Real</strong></p>
        <p>A Guarda Real é composta por muitos clãs e tem jogadores de vários níveis como membros. Os deveres da RG continuarão seus deveres normais como coleta de impostos e aplicação das regras do Palácio. Eles também atuarão como um exército de elite e unidade de patrulha e defesa do reino/território. Eles são a ponta da lança do reino e estão aqui para ajudar clãs que têm problemas com jogadores e foras da lei.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones CoT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Durante, você pode fazer scouting e atacar cidades nas seguintes condições:</li>
            <li>Sem ataques a fortes de clã: atacar os fortes ou edifícios de outro clã é estritamente proibido.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Gestão de Recursos</strong></p>
        <p>Mantenha os recursos baixos durante o evento para evitar roubo; envie tropas para fortes se necessário. Pratique No Value City (NVC).</p>
        <p><strong>"Fair Play"</strong></p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>A regra de 50% se aplica.</li>
            <li>Se você for atacado, independentemente do seu might, você pode atacar qualquer um de volta. Isso significa que, se um jogador com 1,000,000 de might atacar um jogador com 50,000,000 de might, o jogador com 50,000,000 de might tem total direito de atacar de volta se desejar.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>8. Processo de resolução de conflitos</h3>
        <p>Quando o ROE é violado, as seguintes etapas devem ser seguidas:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Entre em contato com o outro jogador para tentar resolver. Se não houver resolução em 24 horas, eleve para o seu diplomata de clã.</li>
            <li>Se nenhuma resolução for alcançada entre diplomatas de clã, eles podem levar a questão à Corte postando em #K273/CLAIMS. Somente líderes de clã ou diplomatas podem postar reivindicações neste chat.</li>
            <li>Os juízes irão julgar para definir a parte culpada (se houver) e um valor aceitável de compensação.</li>
            <li>Se a parte culpada (ou seu clã) se recusar a compensar, o Arconte ou o Juiz Chefe determinará se o jogador ou clã deve ser declarado fora da lei e a Guarda Real será ativada em espera.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

        <h3>Ogólna umowa graczy K273</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Królestwo K273 przestrzega porozumienia IKFPA ustanowionego podczas panowania Króla Arcadii i oczekuje, że każdy członek będzie go przestrzegał, szczególnie po otwarciu królestwa.</li>
            <li>ROE obowiązuje natychmiast i może być zmieniane.</li>
            <li>Każda zmiana będzie mieć 24-godzinny okres buforowy, aby inni mogli się dostosować w różnych strefach czasowych.</li>

            <li>Mogą otrzymać negatywny tytuł i/lub status wyjętego spod prawa.</li>
            <li>Groźby są traktowane bardzo poważnie, podobnie jak nękanie, ponieważ są sprzeczne z zasadami Kodeksu Postępowania TOTAL BATTLE. Czat królestwa to miejsce, w którym wszyscy mają czuć się mile widziani.</li>
            <li>Królestwo jest uznawane za pokojowe w każdym czasie.</li>

        <p>To ogólne porozumienia między różnymi królestwami na czas otwarcia K273. Nie są to twarde zasady, ale królestwa zachęcają do ich przestrzegania.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Zakaz mowy nienawiści.</li>
            <li>Zakaz ataków na budynki klanowe, portale pamięci lub graczy poniżej 100K potęgi.</li>

            <li>Ataki na forty w innych królestwach skutkują natychmiastowym statusem wyjętego spod prawa zgodnie z ROE królestwa.</li>
            <li>Rekompensata za naruszenia ustalana w ciągu 48 godzin (IKFPA nie jest egzekwowane przez żadną pojedynczą instytucję).</li>

    <li>
        <h3>Obowiązki liderów klanów</h3>
        <p>Wszyscy liderzy klanów muszą wypełniać swoje obowiązki jako liderzy:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Szanuj ROE (Rules of Engagement).</li>

    <li>
        <h3>1. CZAS POKOJU</h3>

Atakowanie portali na terytoriach klanu w ramach aktywności klanowych nie jest dozwolone, chyba że są wrogie.</li>
            <li>Zasady portali CoT: brak ograniczeń.</li>

            <li>Jeśli zostaniesz zaatakowany, niezależnie od ich potęgi, masz prawo atakować każdego z powrotem w dowolnym momencie. Oznacza to, że jeśli gracz o potędze 1,000,000 atakuje gracza o potędze 50,000,000, gracz o potędze 50,000,000 ma pełne prawo do odwetu, jeśli zechce.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>2. KLANI I DYPLOMACI</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Klany powinny podać "We abide by K273 ROE", aby były obsługiwane przez królestwo i chronione przez ROE.</li>
            <li>Klany muszą wskazać co najmniej jednego dyplomatę na początku opisu klanu, który może pomóc w rozwiązywaniu sporów. Dyplomaci muszą być aktywnym liderem lub przełożonym.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>3. Zasady ogólne</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Wszystkie budynki zasobów na terytorium klanu należą do tego klanu. Obejmuje to zasoby wydarzeń sezonowych.</li>

        <h3>5. PODATKI</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Miasta z ponad 3 dniami zgromadzonych sztabek mogą zostać zaatakowane przez członka Gwardii Królewskiej 24 godziny po ostrzeżeniu gracza i lidera klanu. Złote sztabki nie mają dla ciebie osobistej wartości, ale Król i Pałac mogą ich użyć do włączenia bonusów dla całego królestwa. Jeśli mamy sztabki złota, zostaną użyte dla dobra K273.</li>
            <li>Maksymalna liczba złotych sztabek na miasto:
                <ul>
                    <li>Miasto 1-9: 2000 sztabek</li>

        <h3>6. Członkowie Szacownego Królestwa</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Każdy gracz musi przestrzegać tych zasad, aby być chronionym przez ROE. Gracze niechronieni to:
                <ul>
                    <li>WYJĘCI SPOD PRAWA</li>
                    <li>GRACZE BEZ KLANU (większość)</li>
                    <li>NIE-UCZESTNICY ROE</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Chronieni gracze bez klanu: Wszyscy gracze o potędze 100k lub mniejszej są chronieni i nie powinni być swobodnie atakowani. Interakcje z graczami bez klanu powinny najpierw służyć poznaniu ich i ich celów w grze, a następnie zachęceniu do dołączenia do klanu. Wspieraj rozwój w grze i graj dla królestwa zamiast dla osobistej nagrody.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Status wyjętego spod prawa</strong></p>
        <p>Uprawnienie do ogłoszenia obywatela lub klanu wyjętym spod prawa lub cofnięcia istniejącego statusu wyjętego spod prawa spoczywa wyłącznie w rękach następujących władz Królestwa:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Król, najwyższy strażnik porządku i sprawiedliwości.</li>
            <li>Ręka Króla, działająca jako bezpośredni przedstawiciel władzy królewskiej.</li>
            <li>Królowa, jako współposiadaczka władzy królewskiej.</li>
            <li>Naczelny Sędzia Trybunału Królestwa, z tytułu swojej roli strażnika sprawiedliwości.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Żaden inny organ Królestwa nie może, bez wyraźnego mandatu udzielonego przez jedną z tych władz, ogłosić obywatela lub klanu wyjętym spod prawa. Każde oświadczenie wydane przez nieupoważniony podmiot będzie nieważne i bezskuteczne.</p>
        <p><strong>Gwardia Królewska</strong></p>
        <p>Gwardia Królewska składa się z wielu klanów i ma członków o różnych poziomach. Obowiązki RG będą kontynuować swoje normalne zadania, takie jak pobór podatków i egzekwowanie zasad dla Pałacu. Będą również działać jako elitarna armia oraz jednostka patrolowa i obronna królestwa/terytorium. Są grotem włóczni królestwa i są tutaj, aby pomagać klanom mającym problemy z graczami i wyjętymi spod prawa.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones CoT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Podczas CoT możesz zwiadować i atakować miasta na następujących warunkach:</li>
            <li>Zakaz ataków na forty klanowe: atakowanie fortów lub budynków innego klanu jest surowo zabronione.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Zarządzanie zasobami</strong></p>
        <p>Utrzymuj zasoby na niskim poziomie podczas wydarzenia, aby uniknąć kradzieży; w razie potrzeby wysyłaj wojska do fortów. Praktykuj No Value City (NVC).</p>
        <p><strong>"Fair Play"</strong></p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Obowiązuje zasada 50%.</li>
            <li>Jeśli zostaniesz zaatakowany, niezależnie od ich potęgi, masz prawo zaatakować kogokolwiek z powrotem. Oznacza to, że jeśli gracz o potędze 1,000,000 atakuje gracza o potędze 50,000,000, gracz o potędze 50,000,000 ma pełne prawo do odwetu, jeśli zechce.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>8. Proces rozwiązywania konfliktów</h3>
        <p>Gdy ROE zostanie naruszone, należy podjąć następujące kroki:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Skontaktuj się z drugim graczem, aby spróbować rozwiązać sprawę. Jeśli brak rozwiązania w ciągu 24 godzin, przekaż sprawę swojemu dyplomacie klanowemu.</li>
            <li>Jeśli nie osiągnięto rozwiązania między dyplomatami klanowymi, mogą wnieść sprawę przed Sąd, publikując ją w #K273/CLAIMS. Tylko liderzy klanu lub dyplomaci mogą publikować roszczenia w tym czacie.</li>
            <li>Sędziowie rozstrzygną, aby określić stronę winną (jeśli taka istnieje) i akceptowalną kwotę rekompensaty.</li>
            <li>Jeśli strona winna (lub jej klan) odmówi rekompensaty, Archon lub Sędzia Naczelny zdecyduje, czy gracz lub klan powinien zostać uznany za wyjętego spod prawa, a Gwardia Królewska zostanie aktywowana w gotowości.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

<p class="roe-intro">По приказу Короля Арихельма следующие ROE действуют в королевстве:</p>
<ol class="roe-list">
    <li>
        <h3>Общее соглашение игроков K273</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Королевство K273 следует соглашению IKFPA, установленному во время правления Короля Аркадии, и ожидает, что каждый член будет соблюдать его, особенно после открытия королевства.</li>
            <li>ROE вступает в силу немедленно и может быть изменен.</li>
            <li>Каждая поправка будет иметь 24-часовой буфер, чтобы другие могли адаптироваться в разных часовых поясах.</li>
            <li>Пожалуйста, уважайте всех, с кем вы вступаете в контакт.</li>
            <li>Действует политика нулевой терпимости к расистским, ненавистническим, уничижительным или угрожающим выражениям.</li>
            <li>Нарушения могут быть сообщены Королю/Королеве или Руке Короля.</li>
            <li>Им может быть присвоен негативный титул и/или статус вне закона.</li>
            <li>Угрозы рассматриваются очень серьезно, как и травля, так как это противоречит правилам Кодекса поведения TOTAL BATTLE. Чат королевства — место, где все должны чувствовать себя желанными.</li>
            <li>Королевство считается мирным в любое время.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Правила Межкоролевского соглашения честной игры (IKFPA)</h3>
        <p>Это общие договоренности между различными королевствами на время открытия K273. Это не жесткие правила, но королевства поощряют их соблюдение.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Запрещена речь ненависти.</li>
            <li>Запрещены атаки на клановые здания, мемориальные порталы или игроков ниже 100K мощи.</li>
            <li>Все клетки RSS защищены от атак, кроме событий PvP. PvP события: CoT, KvK, War Tools, Gold / Silver Rush, War Games, Lava Trials (не включает конкретно Ruthless Slaughter).</li>
            <li>Атаки на форты других королевств приводят к немедленному статусу вне закона согласно ROE королевства.</li>
            <li>Компенсация за нарушения должна быть согласована в течение 48 часов (IKFPA не обеспечивается какой-либо единой организацией).</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Должностные лица королевства - Дворец</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Дворец отвечает за поддержание чести, целостности и мира внутри K273 и с другими королевствами.</li>
            <li>Король избирается, чтобы представлять граждан K273 и председательствовать во дворце.</li>
            <li>Королева и Рука Короля отвечают за координацию дел королевства и могут говорить от имени Короля в его отсутствие.</li>
            <li>Король, Королева и Рука Короля отвечают за управление казной от имени игроков королевства.</li>
            <li>Королева и Рука Короля должны быть из разных кланов.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Обязанности лидеров кланов</h3>
        <p>Все лидеры кланов должны выполнять свои обязанности как лидеры:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Соблюдать ROE (Rules of Engagement).</li>
            <li>Обеспечивать, чтобы их участники уважали и соблюдали ROE.</li>
            <li>Обучать своих участников, чтобы поддерживать рост и единство королевства.</li>
            <li>Лидер, который не выполняет эти обязательства, будет объявлен Вне закона. &gt;=D</li>
            <li>Лидеры являются примером и стандартом королевства, и их действия задают путь для всех участников.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>1. МИРНОЕ ВРЕМЯ</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Атаки на города запрещены, кроме CoT и запланированных обменов CP.</li>
            <li>Атаки на клановые здания запрещены.</li>
            <li>Порталы в мирное время: не трогать и никаких boop boops, кроме CoT. Это означает никаких атак на порталы нигде, если только они не доказаны как враждебные. Враждебные порталы включают атаки на здания клана, членов и все игровые ресурсы (включая ресурсы сезонных событий). Атаковать порталы на территориях клана для клановой активности нельзя, если только они не враждебные.</li>
            <li>Правила порталов CoT: без ограничений.</li>
            <li>Разведка является формой агрессии и незаконна в мирное время.</li>
            <li>Если вас атаковали, независимо от их мощи, вам разрешено атаковать любого в ответ в любое время. То есть, если игрок с мощью 1,000,000 атакует игрока с мощью 50,000,000, игрок с мощью 50,000,000 имеет полное право атаковать в ответ, если он этого хочет.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>2. КЛАНЫ И ДИПЛОМАТЫ</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Кланы должны указать "We abide by K273 ROE", чтобы королевство могло их обслуживать и защищать по ROE.</li>
            <li>Кланы должны указать как минимум одного дипломата в начале описания клана, который может помочь в разрешении споров. Дипломаты должны быть активным лидером или старшим.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>3. Общие правила</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Все здания ресурсов на территории клана принадлежат этому клану. Это включает ресурсы сезонных событий.</li>
            <li>Ресурсы, созданные игроками, принадлежат человеку, который их создал, если не согласовано совместное использование между двумя сторонами.</li>
            <li>Редкие крипты принадлежат человеку, который их открыл.</li>
            <li>WS и DMs:
                <ul>
                    <li>a. Системы регистрации нет. Все дикие здания ресурсов (включая DM/WS) работают по принципу первым пришел, первым обслужен (FCFS).</li>
                    <li>c. Претензии не могут быть заявлены, если вас разведали/атаковали на диких ресурсах, кроме случаев
                        <ul>
                            <li>Вы теряете ресурс.</li>
                            <li>Вас разведали/атаковали, а затем атаковали снова. (правило 2x)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>d. Ваша обязанность — написать вашему дипломату, другому игроку и их дипломату/лидеру клана, если кто-то разведует вас или атакует вас в шахте.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>4. РУКОВОДСТВО ПО КОМПЕНСАЦИИ ДВОРЦА</h3>
        <p>Пожалуйста, смотрите k273tb.xyz для калькулятора компенсации.</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Каждая незаконная атака или разведка несет базовую стоимость 1 миллион серебра. Любые дополнительные потери, повреждения или украденные ресурсы добавляются сверх этой базовой стоимости.</li>
            <li>RSS: сумма, равная украденной сумме</li>
            <li>Золото: 1 Золото = 3,000 Серебро или золотые шахты равные украденному + 10% (по решению жертвы)</li>
            <li>Смола: 1 Смола = 1,000 Серебро</li>
            <li>Золотые слитки = без компенсации</li>
            <li>Незаконно закрытый портал: 1M серебра (+1M за саму незаконную атаку)</li>
            <li>Урон рассчитывается по следующей формуле: Потери войск рассчитываются по следующей формуле:
                <ul>
                    <li>Герой = 1.5k</li>
                    <li>Капитан = 1k</li>
                    <li>Копейщики, Лучники = Уровень войск x 40</li>
                    <li>Специалисты, Всадники = Уровень войск x 80</li>
                    <li>Шпионы = Уровень войск x 100</li>
                    <li>Грифоны = Уровень войск x 800</li>

        <h3>5. НАЛОГИ</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Города с более чем 3 днями накопленных слитков могут быть атакованы членом Королевской Гвардии через 24 часа после предупреждения игрока и лидера клана. Золотые слитки не имеют для вас личной ценности, но Король и Дворец могут использовать их для включения бонусов для всего королевства. Если у нас есть золотые слитки, они будут использованы на благо K273.</li>
            <li>Максимум золотых слитков на город:
                <ul>
                    <li>Город 1-9: 2000 слитков</li>
                    <li>Город 10-19: 3000 слитков</li>
                    <li>Город 20-24: 10000 слитков</li>

        <h3>6. Члены Почитаемого Королевства</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Каждый игрок должен соблюдать эти правила, чтобы быть защищенным ROE. Игроки, не защищенные, это:
                <ul>
                    <li>ВНЕ ЗАКОНА</li>
                    <li>ИГРОКИ БЕЗ КЛАНА (большинство)</li>
                    <li>НЕ-УЧАСТНИКИ ROE</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Защищенные игроки без клана: Все игроки с мощью 100k или ниже защищены и не должны свободно атаковаться. Взаимодействие с игроками без клана должно сначала быть направлено на знакомство с ними и их целями в игре, затем — на поощрение вступления в клан. Содействуйте росту в игре и играйте за королевство, а не ради личной награды.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Статус вне закона</strong></p>
        <p>Полномочия объявлять гражданина или клан вне закона или отзывать существующий статус вне закона принадлежат исключительно следующим властям Королевства:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Король, верховный хранитель порядка и справедливости.</li>
            <li>Рука Короля, действующая как прямой представитель королевской власти.</li>
            <li>Королева, как совместный носитель королевской власти.</li>
            <li>Главный судья Трибунала Королевства, по праву своей роли хранителя правосудия.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ни один другой орган Королевства не может без явного мандата, предоставленного одной из этих властей, объявить гражданина или клан вне закона. Любое заявление, сделанное неуполномоченным лицом, является недействительным.</p>
        <p><strong>Королевская Гвардия</strong></p>
        <p>Королевская Гвардия состоит из многих кланов и включает игроков разных уровней. Обязанности RG будут продолжать свои обычные обязанности, такие как сбор налогов и обеспечение порядка для Дворца. Они также будут действовать как элитная армия и подразделение патруля и обороны королевства/территории. Они являются острием копья королевства и призваны помогать кланам, у которых есть проблемы с игроками и вне закона.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones CoT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Во время CoT вы можете разведывать и атаковать города при следующих условиях:</li>
            <li>Без атак на клановые форты: атаки на форты или здания другого клана строго запрещены.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Управление ресурсами</strong></p>
        <p>Держите ресурсы низкими во время события, чтобы избежать краж; отправляйте войска в форты при необходимости. Практикуйте No Value City (NVC).</p>
        <p><strong>"Fair Play"</strong></p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Применяется правило 50%.</li>
            <li>Если вас атаковали, независимо от их мощи, вам разрешено атаковать любого в ответ. То есть, если игрок с мощью 1,000,000 атакует игрока с мощью 50,000,000, игрок с мощью 50,000,000 имеет полное право атаковать в ответ, если он этого хочет.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>8. Процесс разрешения конфликтов</h3>
        <p>Когда ROE нарушен, следует предпринять следующие шаги:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Свяжитесь с другим игроком, чтобы попытаться решить. Если нет решения в течение 24 часов, эскалируйте к вашему клановому дипломату.</li>
            <li>Если решение не достигнуто между клановыми дипломатами, они могут вынести вопрос в Суд, разместив его в #K273/CLAIMS. Только лидеры клана или дипломаты могут публиковать претензии в этом чате.</li>
            <li>Судьи вынесут решение, чтобы определить виновную сторону (если есть) и приемлемую сумму компенсации.</li>
            <li>Если виновная сторона (или ее клан) отказывается компенсировать, Архон или Главный судья определит, следует ли объявить игрока или клан вне закона, и Королевская Гвардия будет активирована в ожидании.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
