            <li>Attacks on clan buildings are prohibited.</li>
            <li>Peacetime Portals: No touchy or boop boops unless CoT. This means no attacking any portals anywhere unless proven hostile.

Attacking portals in clan territories for clan activities is not allowed unless hostile.</li>
            <li>CoT Portal Rules: No restrictions.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>4. PALACE COMPENSATION GUIDE</h3>
        <p>Please see k273tb.xyz for compensation calculator.</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Every illegal attack or scouting carries a base cost of 1 million silver. Any additional losses, damages, or stolen resources are added on top of this base cost.</li>
            <li>RSS: amount equal to the amount stolen</li>
            <li>Gold: 1 Gold = 3,000 Silver or gold mines equal to stolen + 10% (by decision of the victim)</li>
            <li>Tar: 1 Tar = 1,000 Silver</li>
            <li>Gold Bars = no compensation</li>
            <li>Illegally closed portal: 1M silver (+1M for illegal attack itself)</li>
            <li>Damage is calculated according to the following formula: Damage of lost troops are calculated according to the following formula:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hero = 1.5k</li>
                    <li>Captain = 1k</li>
                    <li>Spearmen, Archers = Troops Level x 40</li>
                    <li>Specialists, Riders = Troops Level x 80</li>
                    <li>Spies = Troops Level x 100</li>
                    <li>Griffins = Troops Level x 800</li>
                    <li>Catapults, Walls Walls Level x 200</li>
                    <li>Monsters III-VII (Monster Level - 2) x 1.3k</li>
                    <li>Monsters I &amp; II = x 8.64k</li>

        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Cities with over 3 days of accrued ingots may be attacked by a member of the Royal Guard 24 hours after warning the player and clan leader. Gold ingots have zero value to you personally, but the King and Palace can use them to turn on bonuses for the whole kingdom. If we have the gold bars, they will be used for the benefit of K273.</li>
            <li>Maximum gold ingots per city:
                <ul>
                    <li>City 1-9: 2000 Ingots</li>
                    <li>City 10-19: 3000 Ingots</li>

        <h3>6. Members of the Esteemed Kingdom</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Every player must abide by these rules to be protected by ROE. Players not protected are:
                <ul>
                    <li>OUTLAWS</li>
                    <li>CLANLESS PLAYERS (most)</li>
                    <li>NON-ROE MEMBERS</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Protected clanless players: All players at or below 100k might are protected and are not to be freely attacked. Interactions with clanless players should first be to learn about them and their goals in the game, followed by encouragement to join a clan. Foster growth in the game and play for the kingdom versus personal reward.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Outlaw status</strong></p>
        <p>The authority to declare a citizen or a clan an Outlaw, or to revoke an existing outlaw status, rests exclusively with the following powers of the Kingdom:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>The King, supreme guardian of order and justice.</li>
            <li>The Hand of the King, acting as the direct representative of royal authority.</li>
            <li>The Queen, as co-holder of the royal authority.</li>
            <li>The Chief Judge of the Kingdom's Tribunal, by virtue of his role as guardian of justice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No other actor of the Kingdom may, without an explicit mandate granted by one of these authorities, declare a citizen or a clan outlaw. Any declaration issued by an unauthorized actor shall be null and void.</p>
        <p><strong>Royal Guard</strong></p>
        <p>The Royal Guard is composed of many clans and has various levels of players as members. The RG duties will continue its normal duties like tax collection and enforcement for the Palace. They will also act as an elite army and kingdom/territorial patrol and defense unit. They are the tip of the spear for the kingdom and are here to assist clans having trouble with players and outlaws.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones CoT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>During, you can scout and attack cities under the following conditions:</li>
            <li>No Clan Fort Attacks: Attacking another clan's forts or buildings is strictly forbidden.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Resource Management</strong></p>
        <p>Keep resources low during the event to avoid theft; send troops to forts if needed. Practice No Value City (NVC).</p>
        <p><strong>"Fair Play"</strong></p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>The 50% rule applies.</li>
            <li>If you are attacked, regardless of their might, you are allowed to attack anyone back. Meaning, if a 1,000,000 might player attacks a 50,000,000 might player, the 50,000,000 might player has full rights to attack back if they choose.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>8. Conflict Resolution Process</h3>
        <p>When the ROE is violated, the following steps should be taken:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Contact the other player to attempt to resolve. If no resolution within 24 hours, elevate to your clan diplomat.</li>
            <li>If no resolution is reached between clan diplomats, they may bring the issue before the Court by posting it in #K273/CLAIMS. Only clan leaders or diplomats are allowed to post claims in this chat.</li>
            <li>The judges will adjudicate to define the guilty party (if any) and an acceptable amount of compensation.</li>
            <li>If the guilty party (or their clan) refuses to compensate, the Archon or Head Judge will determine whether the player or clan should be declared an Outlaw and the Royal Guard will be activated on stand-by.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

        <h3>K273:n yleinen pelaajasopimus</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Kuningaskunta K273 noudattaa IKFPA-sopimusta, joka luotiin kuningas Arcadian valtakaudella, ja odottaa jokaisen jäsenen noudattavan sitä, erityisesti kuningaskunnan avautumisen jälkeen.</li>
            <li>ROE on voimassa välittömästi ja sitä voidaan muuttaa.</li>
            <li>Jokaisella muutoksella on 24 tunnin siirtymäaika, jotta muut voivat sopeutua eri aikavyöhykkeiden vuoksi.</li>
            <li>Kunnioita kaikkia, joiden kanssa olet tekemisissä.</li>
            <li>Rasistista, vihamielistä, halventavaa tai uhkaavaa kieltä kohtaan on nollatoleranssi.</li>

            <li>Heille voidaan antaa negatiivinen titteli ja/tai lainsuojattoman status.</li>
            <li>Uhkaus ja kiusaaminen otetaan erittäin vakavasti, sillä ne ovat TOTAL BATTLE -käytännesääntöjen vastaisia. Kuningaskunnan chat on paikka, jossa kaikkien tulee tuntea olonsa tervetulleeksi.</li>

        <p>Nämä ovat yleisiä sopimuksia eri kuningaskuntien välillä K273:n avautuessa. Ne eivät ole tiukkoja sääntöjä, mutta kuningaskunnat rohkaisevat noudattamaan niitä.</p>

            <li>Linnoitushyökkäykset muihin kuningaskuntiin johtavat välittömään lainsuojattomuuteen kuningaskunnan ROE:n mukaisesti.</li>
            <li>Korvaukset rikkomuksista sovitaan 48 tunnin kuluessa (IKFPA:ta ei valvo mikään yksittäinen taho).</li>

            <li>Palatsi vastaa kunnian, rehellisyyden ja rauhan ylläpidosta K273:ssa ja muiden kuningaskuntien kanssa.</li>
            <li>Kuningas valitaan edustamaan K273:n kansalaisia ja johtamaan palatsia.</li>

        <h3>Klaanijohtajien velvollisuudet</h3>
        <p>Kaikkien klaanijohtajien on täytettävä velvollisuutensa johtajina:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Kunnioittaa ROE:ta (Rules of Engagement).</li>
            <li>Varmistaa, että heidän jäsenensä kunnioittavat ja noudattavat ROE:ta.</li>

            <li>Rauhanajan portaalit: Ei kosketa tai boop boop -hyökkäyksiä ilman CoT:ia. Tämä tarkoittaa, ettei portaalien hyökkääminen ole sallittua missään, ellei portaalia ole todistettu vihamieliseksi. Vihamielisiin portaaleihin kuuluvat hyökkäykset klaanien rakennuksiin, jäseniin ja kaikkiin pelin resursseihin (mukaan lukien kausitapahtumien resurssit). Portaaleihin hyökkääminen klaanialueilla klaanitoimintoja varten ei ole sallittua, ellei portaali ole vihamielinen.</li>
            <li>CoT-portaalisäännöt: Ei rajoituksia.</li>
            <li>Tiedustelu on aggression muoto ja on laitonta rauhan aikana.</li>
            <li>Jos sinua hyökätään, riippumatta heidän mightistaan, sinulla on oikeus hyökätä ketä tahansa takaisin milloin tahansa. Toisin sanoen, jos 1,000,000 mightin pelaaja hyökkää 50,000,000 mightin pelaajan kimppuun, 50,000,000 mightin pelaajalla on täysi oikeus hyökätä takaisin, jos hän niin haluaa.</li>

        <h3>2. KLAANIT &amp; DIPLOMAATIT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Klaanien tulisi ilmoittaa "We abide by K273 ROE", jotta kuningaskunta palvelee heitä ja he ovat ROE:n suojaamia.</li>
            <li>Klaanien on nimettävä vähintään yksi diplomaatti klaanikuvauksen alkuun, joka voi auttaa riitojen ratkaisussa. Diplomaatin on oltava aktiivinen johtaja tai ylempi.</li>

Kultaharkot eivät ole sinulle henkilökohtaisesti minkään arvoisia, mutta kuningas ja palatsi voivat käyttää niitä bonusten kytkemiseen koko kuningaskunnalle.

        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Jokaisen pelaajan on noudatettava näitä sääntöjä ollakseen ROE:n suojaama. Pelaajat, joita ei suojata, ovat:
                <ul>
                    <li>LAINSUOJATTOMAT</li>
                    <li>KLAANITTOMAT PELAAJAT (useimmat)</li>

            <li>Suojatut klaanittomat pelaajat: Kaikki pelaajat, joiden might on 100k tai vähemmän, ovat suojattuja eikä heihin saa hyökätä vapaasti. Vuorovaikutuksen klaanittomien pelaajien kanssa tulee ensin olla heidän taustansa ja tavoitteidensa selvittäminen pelissä, jota seuraa kannustus liittyä klaaniin. Edistä kasvua pelissä ja pelaa kuningaskunnan hyväksi henkilökohtaisen palkkion sijaan.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Lainsuojattoman status</strong></p>
        <p>Valta julistaa kansalainen tai klaani lainsuojattomaksi tai peruuttaa olemassa oleva lainsuojattoman status kuuluu yksinomaan seuraaville kuningaskunnan valtuuksille:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Kuningas, järjestyksen ja oikeuden ylin suojelija.</li>
            <li>Kuninkaan oikea käsi, joka toimii kuninkaallisen vallan suorana edustajana.</li>
            <li>Kuningatar, kuninkaallisen vallan yhteishaltijana.</li>
            <li>Kuningaskunnan tuomioistuimen päätuomari, oikeuden suojelijan roolinsa perusteella.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Kukaan muu kuningaskunnan toimija ei voi ilman jonkin näistä valtuuksista myönnettyä nimenomaista valtuutusta julistaa kansalaista tai klaania lainsuojattomaksi. Luvattoman toimijan antama julistus on mitätön.</p>
        <p><strong>Kuninkaallinen Kaarti</strong></p>
        <p>Kuninkaallinen Kaarti koostuu monista klaaneista ja sen jäseninä on eri tasoisia pelaajia. RG:n tehtävät jatkuvat normaaleina velvollisuuksina kuten verojen keruu ja palatsin toimeenpano. He toimivat myös eliittiarmeijana sekä kuningaskunnan/alueen partio- ja puolustusyksikkönä. He ovat kuningaskunnan keihäänkärki ja ovat täällä auttamassa klaaneja, joilla on ongelmia pelaajien ja lainsuojattomien kanssa.</p>

        <p><strong>"Reilu peli"</strong></p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>50 % sääntö on voimassa.</li>

        <p>Kun ROE:ta rikotaan, tulee tehdä seuraavat toimenpiteet:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Ota yhteyttä toiseen pelaajaan ratkaistaksesi asian. Jos ratkaisua ei synny 24 tunnin kuluessa, siirrä asia klaanidiplomaatillesi.</li>
            <li>Jos klaanidiplomaatit eivät pääse ratkaisuun, he voivat viedä asian oikeuden eteen julkaisemalla sen #K273/CLAIMS-kanavalla. Vain klaanijohtajat tai diplomaatit saavat julkaista vaatimuksia tässä chatissa.</li>
            <li>Tuomarit ratkaisevat syyllisen osapuolen (jos sellainen on) ja hyväksyttävän korvauksen määrän.</li>
            <li>Jos syyllinen osapuoli (tai heidän klaaninsa) kieltäytyy korvaamasta, Archon tai päätuomari päättää, pitäisikö pelaaja tai klaani julistaa lainsuojattomaksi, ja Kuninkaallinen Kaarti asetetaan valmiustilaan.</li>

<p class="roe-intro">På ordre fra Kong Arihelm gjelder følgende ROE for kongeriket:</p>
<ol class="roe-list">
    <li>
        <h3>Generell K273-spilleravtale</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Kongeriket K273 følger IKFPA-avtalen som ble etablert under Kong Arcadias styre og forventer at hvert medlem følger den, spesielt etter at kongeriket åpner.</li>
            <li>ROE gjelder umiddelbart og kan endres.</li>
            <li>Hver endring har en 24-timers buffer slik at andre kan tilpasse seg på tvers av tidssoner.</li>
            <li>Vennligst respekter alle du kommer i kontakt med.</li>
            <li>Det er nulltoleranse for rasistisk, hatefult, nedsettende eller truende språk.</li>
            <li>Brudd kan rapporteres til Kongen/Dronningen eller Kongens høyre hånd.</li>
            <li>De kan få en negativ tittel og/eller bli erklært fredløse.</li>
            <li>Trusler tas svært alvorlig, og det samme gjelder mobbing, da dette bryter TOTAL BATTLEs Code of Conduct. Kingdom chat er et sted hvor alle skal føle seg velkomne.</li>
            <li>Kongeriket anses som fredelig til enhver tid.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Inter-kongerikets avtale om fair play (IKFPA) regler</h3>
        <p>Dette er generelle avtaler mellom ulike kongeriker når K273 åpner. De er ikke harde regler, men kongeriker oppfordres til å følge dem.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ingen hatprat.</li>
            <li>Ingen angrep på klanbygninger, memorial portaler eller spillere under 100K might.</li>
            <li>Alle RSS-felt er beskyttet mot angrep unntatt under PvP-events. PvP-events er: CoT, KvK, War Tools, Gold / Silver Rush, War Games, Lava Trials (inkluderer IKKE Ruthless Slaughter spesielt).</li>
            <li>Fort-angrep på andre kongeriker gir umiddelbar fredløs-status per kongerikets ROE.</li>
            <li>Kompensasjon for brudd avtales innen 48 timer (IKFPA håndheves ikke av en enkelt enhet).</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Kongerikets embetsmenn - Palasset</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Palasset er ansvarlig for å opprettholde ære, integritet og fred innenfor K273 og med andre kongeriker.</li>
            <li>Kongen er valgt for å representere innbyggerne i K273 og lede palasset.</li>
            <li>Dronningen og Kongens høyre hånd er ansvarlige for å koordinere kongerikets saker og kan tale på Kongens vegne i hans fravær.</li>
            <li>Kongen, Dronningen og Kongens høyre hånd er ansvarlige for forvaltningen av skattkammeret på vegne av kongerikets spillere.</li>
            <li>Dronningen og Kongens høyre hånd må være fra forskjellige klaner.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Forpliktelser for klanledere</h3>
        <p>Alle klanledere må oppfylle sine forpliktelser som ledere:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Å respektere ROE (Rules of Engagement).</li>
            <li>Å sørge for at deres medlemmer respekterer og følger ROE.</li>
            <li>Å utdanne medlemmene for å støtte vekst og enhet i kongeriket.</li>
            <li>En leder som feiler i disse forpliktelsene skal erklæres fredløs. &gt;=D</li>
            <li>Ledere er eksempelet og standarden for kongeriket, og deres handlinger setter retningen for alle medlemmer.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>1. FREDSTID</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Angrep på byer er forbudt unntatt under CoT og planlagte CP-utvekslinger.</li>
            <li>Angrep på klanbygninger er forbudt.</li>
            <li>Fredstid portaler: Ingen berøring eller boop boops uten CoT. Dette betyr ingen angrep på portaler noe sted med mindre de er bevist fiendtlige. Fiendtlige portaler inkluderer angrep på klanens bygninger, medlemmer og alle spillressurser (inkludert sesongressurser). Å angripe portaler i klanterritorium for klanaktiviteter er ikke tillatt med mindre de er fiendtlige.</li>
            <li>CoT portalregler: Ingen restriksjoner.</li>
            <li>Speiding er en form for aggresjon og er ulovlig i fredstid.</li>
            <li>Hvis du blir angrepet, uansett deres might, har du lov til å angripe hvem som helst tilbake når som helst. Det betyr at hvis en spiller med 1,000,000 might angriper en spiller med 50,000,000 might, har 50,000,000-might-spilleren full rett til å angripe tilbake hvis de ønsker.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>2. KLANER &amp; DIPLOMATER</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Klaner bør skrive "We abide by K273 ROE" for å bli betjent av kongeriket og beskyttet av ROE.</li>
            <li>Klaner må identifisere minst én diplomat øverst i klanbeskrivelsen som kan hjelpe med tvisteløsning. Diplomater må være aktive ledere eller overordnede.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>3. Generelle regler</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Alle ressursbygninger innenfor klanterritoriet tilhører den klanen. Dette inkluderer sesongevent-ressurser.</li>
            <li>Ressurser laget av spillere tilhører den som laget dem med mindre to parter blir enige om å dele.</li>
            <li>Sjeldne kryptor tilhører den som åpnet dem.</li>
            <li>WS og DMs:
                <ul>
                    <li>a. Det finnes ikke noe registreringssystem. Alle ville ressursbygninger (inkludert DM/WS) er førstemann til mølla (FCFS).</li>
                    <li>c. Krav kan ikke gjøres hvis du blir speidet/angrepet i ville ressurser med mindre
                        <ul>
                            <li>Du mister ressursen.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>d. Det er ditt ansvar å sende melding til din diplomat, den andre spilleren og den motsatte diplomaten/klanlederen hvis noen speider deg eller angriper deg i en gruve.</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Byer med mer enn 3 dagers opptjente barrer kan angripes av et medlem av Den Kongelige Garden 24 timer etter at spilleren og klanlederen er advart. Gullbarrer har null verdi for deg personlig, men Kongen og Palasset kan bruke dem til å aktivere bonuser for hele kongeriket. Hvis vi har gullbarrer, brukes de til fordel for K273.</li>

        <h3>6. Medlemmer av det aktede kongeriket</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Hver spiller må følge disse reglene for å være beskyttet av ROE. Spillere som ikke er beskyttet er:
                <ul>
                    <li>FREDLØSE</li>
                    <li>KLANLØSE SPILLERE (de fleste)</li>
                    <li>IKKE-ROE MEDLEMMER</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Beskyttede klanløse spillere: Alle spillere på eller under 100k might er beskyttet og skal ikke angripes fritt. Interaksjoner med klanløse spillere bør først være å lære om dem og deres mål i spillet, etterfulgt av oppfordring til å bli med i en klan. Frem dyrking i spillet og spill for kongeriket fremfor personlig belønning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Fredløs-status</strong></p>
        <p>Myndigheten til å erklære en borger eller en klan fredløs, eller å oppheve en eksisterende fredløs-status, ligger utelukkende hos følgende myndigheter i Kongeriket:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Kongen, øverste beskytter av orden og rettferdighet.</li>
            <li>Kongens høyre hånd, som fungerer som den direkte representanten for kongelig myndighet.</li>
            <li>Dronningen, som medinnehaver av den kongelige myndigheten.</li>
            <li>Hoveddommeren i Kongerikets tribunal, i kraft av sin rolle som rettferdighetens vokter.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ingen annen aktør i Kongeriket kan, uten et uttrykkelig mandat gitt av en av disse myndighetene, erklære en borger eller en klan fredløs. Enhver erklæring utstedt av en uautorisert aktør er ugyldig.</p>
        <p><strong>Den Kongelige Garden</strong></p>
        <p>Den Kongelige Garden består av mange klaner og har spillere på ulike nivåer som medlemmer. RG-oppgavene vil fortsette sine normale oppgaver som skatteinnkreving og håndheving for Palasset. De vil også fungere som en elitehær og en patrulje- og forsvarsenhet for kongeriket/territoriet. De er spydspissen for kongeriket og er her for å hjelpe klaner som har problemer med spillere og fredløse.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones (CoT)</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Under eventet kan du speide og angripe byer under følgende betingelser:</li>
            <li>Ingen klanfort-angrep: Angrep på en annen klans forter eller bygninger er strengt forbudt.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Ressurshåndtering</strong></p>
        <p>Hold ressursene lave under eventet for å unngå tyveri; send tropper til forter om nødvendig. Praktiser No Value City (NVC).</p>
        <p><strong>"Fair Play"</strong></p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>50 %-regelen gjelder.</li>
            <li>Hvis du blir angrepet, uansett deres might, har du lov til å angripe hvem som helst tilbake. Det betyr at hvis en spiller med 1,000,000 might angriper en spiller med 50,000,000 might, har 50,000,000-might-spilleren full rett til å angripe tilbake hvis de ønsker.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>8. Konfliktløsningsprosess</h3>
        <p>Når ROE brytes, bør følgende trinn tas:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Kontakt den andre spilleren for å forsøke å løse saken. Hvis ingen løsning innen 24 timer, eskaler til din klan-diplomat.</li>
            <li>Hvis ingen løsning oppnås mellom klan-diplomater, kan de bringe saken inn for domstolen ved å poste den i #K273/CLAIMS. Kun klanledere eller diplomater har lov til å poste krav i denne chatten.</li>
            <li>Dommerne vil avgjøre skyldig part (om noen) og en akseptabel kompensasjon.</li>
            <li>Hvis den skyldige parten (eller deres klan) nekter å kompensere, vil Archon eller hoveddommer avgjøre om spilleren eller klanen skal erklæres fredløs, og Den Kongelige Garden settes i beredskap.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

            <li>Städte mit über 3 Tagen angesammelten Barren können 24 Stunden nach Warnung des Spielers und Clanführers von einem Mitglied der Königlichen Garde angegriffen werden. Goldbarren haben für dich persönlich keinen Wert, aber der König und der Palast können sie verwenden, um Boni für das ganze Königreich zu aktivieren.

        <h3>6. Mitglieder des geschätzten Königreichs</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Jeder Spieler muss diese Regeln einhalten, um durch das ROE geschützt zu sein. Spieler, die nicht geschützt sind:
                <ul>
                    <li>GEÄCHTETE</li>
                    <li>CLANLOSE SPIELER (die meisten)</li>
                    <li>NICHT-ROE-MITGLIEDER</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Geschützte clanlose Spieler: Alle Spieler mit oder unter 100k Might sind geschützt und dürfen nicht frei angegriffen werden. Interaktionen mit clanlosen Spielern sollten zuerst dazu dienen, sie und ihre Ziele im Spiel kennenzulernen, gefolgt von der Ermutigung, einem Clan beizutreten. Fördert Wachstum im Spiel und spielt für das Königreich statt für persönliche Belohnung.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Status als Geächteter</strong></p>
        <p>Die Befugnis, einen Bürger oder einen Clan zum Geächteten zu erklären oder einen bestehenden Geächtetenstatus zu widerrufen, liegt ausschließlich bei den folgenden Mächten des Königreichs:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Der König, oberster Hüter von Ordnung und Gerechtigkeit.</li>
            <li>Die Hand des Königs, als direkter Vertreter der königlichen Autorität.</li>
            <li>Die Königin, als Mitträgerin der königlichen Autorität.</li>
            <li>Der Oberste Richter des Königreichstribunals, kraft seines Amtes als Hüter der Gerechtigkeit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Kein anderer Akteur des Königreichs darf ohne ein ausdrückliches Mandat einer dieser Autoritäten einen Bürger oder einen Clan zum Geächteten erklären. Jede von einer nicht autorisierten Stelle ausgesprochene Erklärung ist null und nichtig.</p>
        <p><strong>Königliche Garde</strong></p>
        <p>Die Königliche Garde besteht aus vielen Clans und hat Mitglieder verschiedener Spielerlevel. Die Aufgaben der RG werden ihre normalen Aufgaben wie Steuererhebung und Durchsetzung für den Palast fortsetzen. Sie werden außerdem als Elitearmee sowie als Patrouillen- und Verteidigungseinheit des Königreichs/Territoriums dienen. Sie sind die Spitze des Speers für das Königreich und sind hier, um Clans zu unterstützen, die Probleme mit Spielern und Geächteten haben.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones CoT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Währenddessen kannst du Städte unter folgenden Bedingungen ausspähen und angreifen:</li>
            <li>Keine Clan-Festungsangriffe: Angriffe auf die Festungen oder Gebäude eines anderen Clans sind strikt verboten.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Ressourcenmanagement</strong></p>
        <p>Halte Ressourcen während des Events niedrig, um Diebstahl zu vermeiden; sende Truppen zu Festungen, wenn nötig. Übe No Value City (NVC).</p>
        <p><strong>"Fair Play"</strong></p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Die 50%-Regel gilt.</li>
            <li>Wenn du angegriffen wirst, unabhängig von deren Might, darfst du jeden zurückangreifen. Das heißt, wenn ein Spieler mit 1.000.000 Might einen Spieler mit 50.000.000 Might angreift, hat der Spieler mit 50.000.000 Might das volle Recht, zurückzugreifen, wenn er möchte.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>8. Konfliktlösungsprozess</h3>
        <p>Wenn das ROE verletzt wird, sollten folgende Schritte unternommen werden:</p>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Kontaktiere den anderen Spieler, um eine Lösung zu finden. Wenn innerhalb von 24 Stunden keine Lösung, eskaliere an deinen Clan-Diplomaten.</li>
            <li>Wenn zwischen Clan-Diplomaten keine Lösung erzielt wird, können sie das Thema vor das Gericht bringen, indem sie es in #K273/CLAIMS posten. Nur Clanführer oder Diplomaten dürfen in diesem Chat Ansprüche posten.</li>
            <li>Die Richter werden entscheiden, wer (falls vorhanden) schuldig ist und eine akzeptable Entschädigungssumme festlegen.</li>
            <li>Wenn die schuldige Partei (oder ihr Clan) sich weigert zu entschädigen, bestimmen der Archon oder der Oberste Richter, ob der Spieler oder Clan zum Geächteten erklärt werden soll, und die Königliche Garde wird in Bereitschaft versetzt.</li>
        </ul>

<p class="roe-intro">Por orden del Rey Arihelm, el siguiente ROE está en vigor para el reino:</p>
<ol class="roe-list">
    <li>
        <h3>1. TIEMPO DE PAZ</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Los ataques a ciudades están prohibidos excepto durante CoT y los intercambios de CP planificados.</li>
            <li><del>Los ataques a portales y edificios de clan están prohibidos. A menos que el portal esté probado como hostil al clan y o sus recursos en su territorio.</del></li>
            <li>Portales en tiempo de paz: Nada de tocar ni boop boops salvo en CoT. Esto significa que no se pueden atacar portales en ningún lugar a menos que se demuestre que son hostiles. Los portales hostiles incluyen ataques a edificios del clan, miembros y todos los recursos del juego (incluidos los recursos de eventos de temporada). Atacar portales en territorios del clan para actividades del clan no está permitido a menos que sean hostiles.</li>
            <li>Reglas de portales en CoT: Sin restricciones.</li>
            <li>El scouting es una forma de agresión.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>2. DIPLOMÁTICOS</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Los clanes deben identificar al menos un diplomático en la descripción de su clan que pueda ayudar con la resolución de disputas. Los diplomáticos deben ser un líder o superior activo.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>3. Reglas Generales</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Todos los edificios de recursos dentro del territorio del clan pertenecen a ese clan.</li>
            <li>Incluyendo WS y DMs.</li>
            <li>Los recursos creados por jugadores pertenecen al individuo que los creó a menos que se acuerde compartir entre dos partes.</li>
            <li>Las criptas raras pertenecen al individuo que las desbloqueó.</li>
            <li>WS y DMs:
                <ul>
                    <li>a. Ya no hay un sistema de registro.</li>
                    <li>b. Todos los edificios de recursos salvajes (incluyendo DM/WS) son por orden de llegada (FCFS).</li>
                    <li>c. No se pueden hacer reclamos si eres scoutado/atacado en recursos salvajes a menos que:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pierdas el edificio.</li>
                            <li>Seas scoutado/atacado y luego atacado de nuevo. (regla 2x)</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>d. Es tu responsabilidad enviar un mensaje a tu diplomático, al otro jugador y a su diplomático/líder de clan si alguien te scoutea o te ataca en una mina.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>4. GUÍA DE COMPENSACIÓN DEL PALACIO --</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Cada ataque o scouting conlleva un costo base de 1 millón de plata. Cualquier pérdida adicional, daño o recurso robado se agrega encima de este costo base.</li>
            <li>RSS: cantidad igual a la cantidad robada</li>
            <li>Oro: 1 Oro = 3,000 Plata o minas de oro iguales a lo robado + 10% (por decisión de la víctima)</li>
            <li>Tar: 1 Tar = 1,000 Plata</li>
            <li>Barras de oro = sin compensación</li>
            <li>Portal cerrado ilegalmente: 1M plata (+1M por el ataque ilegal en sí)</li>
            <li>El daño se calcula de acuerdo con la siguiente fórmula: Las pérdidas de tropas se calculan de acuerdo con la siguiente fórmula:
                <ul>
                    <li>Héroe= 1.5k</li>
                    <li>Capitán= 1k</li>
                    <li>Lanceros, Arqueros = Nivel de tropas x 40</li>

                    <li>Espías= Nivel de tropas x 100</li>
                    <li>Grifos= Nivel de tropas x 800</li>
                    <li>Catapultas, Murallas Nivel de murallas x 200</li>
                    <li>Monstruos III-VII (Nivel de monstruo ⁃ 2) x1.3k</li>
                    <li>Monstruos I & II = x 8.64k</li>
                    <li>Guardia mercenaria Nivel de tropas x120</li>
                    <li>Monstruo mercenario = Nivel de monstruo x 3k</li>

            </li>
            <li>- FUERTES -
                <ul>
                    <li>Scouting = 5 millones de plata</li>
                    <li>Atacar sin destruir = 10 millones de plata</li>
                    <li>Atacar y destruir = 20 millones de cada Plata, Iron, Wood, Stone</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>- CAPITALES -

            </li>
        </ul>

    <li>
        <h3>5. IMPUESTOS</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Las ciudades con más de 3 días de lingotes acumulados pueden ser atacadas por un miembro de la Guardia Real después de recibir 24 horas de aviso. Los lingotes de oro no tienen valor para ti personalmente, pero el Rey puede usarlos para activar bonificaciones para todo el reino. Si tenemos las barras de oro, se usarán en beneficio de K273.</li>
            <li>Máximo de lingotes de oro por ciudad:
                <ul>
                    <li>Ciudad 1-9: 2000 Lingotes</li>
                    <li>Ciudad 10-19: 3000 Lingotes</li>
                    <li>Ciudad 20-24: 10000 Lingotes</li>
                    <li>Ciudad 25-29: 35000 Lingotes</li>
                    <li>Ciudad 30-34: 60000 Lingotes</li>

            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>6. Miembros del Reino Estimado</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Cada jugador debe cumplir estas reglas para estar protegido por el ROE. Los jugadores no protegidos son:
                <ul>
                    <li>FORAJIDOS</li>
                    <li>JUGADORES SIN CLAN</li>
                    <li>MIEMBROS NO-ROE</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Forajidos – Si individuos o clanes no están dispuestos a cumplir con el ROE, que atacan edificios de clan, o se niegan a pagar compensación por violaciones del ROE recibirán el estatus de forajido. Los Forajidos actuales se pueden encontrar en #K273/OUTLAWS. La lista actual de forajidos se eliminará y comenzará de nuevo. Esto significa que actualmente no hay forajidos en el reino. La nueva Guardia Real compartirá responsabilidades en la asistencia del reino.</li>
            <li>Guardia Real: La nueva Guardia Real está compuesta por muchos clanes y tiene jugadores muy fuertes como miembros. Los deberes de la RG continuarán sus deberes normales como la recolección de impuestos y la aplicación para el Palacio. Los deberes adicionales ahora incluirán asistencia para ayudar a los clanes con forajidos y al reino con precisión. También actuarán como un ejército de élite y una unidad de patrulla y defensa del reino/territorio.</li>
            <li>Además de activar relaciones con los grandes clanes del reino para ayudar según sea necesario.</li>
            <li>Los jugadores sin clan en o por debajo de 250k de poder están protegidos y no deben ser atacados libremente.</li>
            <li>Los jugadores sin clan de menos de 250k de poder atacados tienen permitido reclamar 2x el monto de compensación.</li>
            <li>Las interacciones con estos jugadores primero deben ser para conocerlos y sus objetivos en el juego. Seguido de aliento para unirse a un clan. Fomentar el crecimiento en el juego y jugar por el reino versus recompensa personal.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones  CoT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Durante, puedes scoutear y atacar ciudades bajo las siguientes condiciones:</li>
            <li>Sin ataques a fuertes de clan: Atacar los fuertes o edificios de otro clan está estrictamente prohibido.</li>
            <li>Gestión de Portales: No aplica restricción de poder. Cualquier portal probado como hostil a los territorios del clan puede ser atacado con justicia rápida por el clan que está siendo atacado. Las marchas de clan están totalmente permitidas para cerrar portales hostiles. Durante la paz normal, los portales no pueden ser atacados en ningún momento a menos que se demuestre hostiles.</li>
            <li>Gestión de Recursos: Mantén los recursos bajos durante el evento para evitar robo; envía tropas a fuertes si es necesario. Practica No Value City (NVC)</li>
            <li>"Fair Play": Atacar a alguien significativamente más débil (p. ej., por debajo de la mitad de tu poder) a menudo se considera mala deportividad y no está permitido. La única instancia en que se permite es para un portal hostil. Los portales dejados abiertos por jugadores que tienen otros miembros atacando a través de ellos siguen siendo culpables por dejar el portal abierto y pueden ser atacados independientemente de su poder. Se debe proporcionar un informe de ataque en todas las reclamaciones realizadas. Por debajo de la mitad de tu poder no está permitido. Se aplica la regla del 50%.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>8. Proceso de resolución de conflictos</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Cuando el ROE es violado, se deben seguir los siguientes pasos:
                <ol>
                    <li>Contacta al otro jugador para intentar resolver. Si no hay resolución dentro de 24 horas, eleva a tu diplomático de clan.</li>
                    <li>Si no se llega a una resolución entre diplomáticos de clan, pueden llevar el asunto ante la Corte publicándolo en #K273/CLAIMS. Solo líderes de clan o diplomáticos pueden publicar reclamaciones en este chat.</li>
                    <li>Los jueces adjudicarán para definir la parte culpable (si la hay) y una cantidad aceptable de compensación.</li>
                    <li>Si la parte culpable (o su clan) se niega a compensar, la Corte Real determinará si el jugador o clan debe ser declarado forajido y la Guardia Real será activada en espera.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

Cela signifie qu'il n'y a actuellement aucun hors-la-loi dans le royaume. La nouvelle Garde Royale partagera les responsabilités d'assistance au royaume.</li>
            <li>Garde Royale: La nouvelle Garde Royale est composée de nombreux clans et compte des joueurs très puissants comme membres. Les devoirs de la RG continueront ses fonctions normales comme la collecte des taxes et l'application pour le Palais. Les tâches supplémentaires incluront désormais l'aide aux clans avec des hors-la-loi et le royaume avec précision. Elle agira aussi comme armée d'élite et unité de patrouille et de défense du royaume/territoire.</li>
            <li>En plus d'activer des relations avec les grands clans du royaume pour aider au besoin.</li>
            <li>Les joueurs sans clan à 250k de puissance ou moins sont protégés et ne doivent pas être librement attaqués.</li>
            <li>Les joueurs sans clan de moins de 250k de puissance attaqués ont droit à 2x le montant de compensation dans les réclamations.</li>
            <li>Les interactions avec ces joueurs devraient d'abord servir à apprendre à les connaître et leurs objectifs dans le jeu. Ensuite encouragement à rejoindre un clan. Favoriser la croissance dans le jeu et jouer pour le royaume plutôt que pour la récompense personnelle.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones  CoT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Pendant, vous pouvez scouter et attaquer des villes sous les conditions suivantes:</li>
            <li>Aucune attaque de fort de clan: Attaquer les forts ou bâtiments d'un autre clan est strictement interdit.</li>
            <li>Gestion des portails: Aucune restriction de puissance ne s'applique. Tout portail prouvé hostile aux territoires du clan peut être attaqué avec une justice rapide par le clan attaqué. Les marches de clan sont entièrement autorisées pour fermer les portails hostiles. Pendant la paix normale, les portails ne peuvent être attaqués à aucun moment sauf s'ils sont prouvés hostiles.</li>
            <li>Gestion des ressources: Gardez les ressources basses pendant l'événement pour éviter le vol; envoyez des troupes aux forts si nécessaire. Pratiquez No Value City (NVC)</li>
            <li>"Fair Play": Attaquer quelqu'un de significativement plus faible (par ex., en dessous de la moitié de votre puissance) est souvent considéré comme une mauvaise sportivité et n'est pas autorisé. La seule instance où c'est autorisé est pour un portail hostile. Les portails laissés ouverts par des joueurs qui ont d'autres membres attaquant à travers eux sont toujours en faute pour avoir laissé le portail ouvert et peuvent être attaqués quel que soit leur puissance. Un rapport d'attaque doit être fourni dans toutes les réclamations faites. En dessous de la moitié de votre puissance n'est pas autorisé. La règle des 50% s'applique.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>8. Processus de résolution des conflits</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Lorsque le ROE est violé, les étapes suivantes doivent être suivies:
                <ol>
                    <li>Contactez l'autre joueur pour tenter de résoudre. Si aucune résolution dans les 24 heures, élevez vers votre diplomate de clan.</li>
                    <li>Si aucune résolution n'est atteinte entre diplomates de clan, ils peuvent porter l'affaire devant la Cour en la publiant dans #K273/CLAIMS. Seuls les chefs de clan ou diplomates sont autorisés à poster des réclamations dans ce chat.</li>
                    <li>Les juges statueront pour définir la partie coupable (le cas échéant) et un montant de compensation acceptable.</li>
                    <li>Si la partie coupable (ou son clan) refuse de compenser, la Cour Royale déterminera si le joueur ou le clan doit être déclaré hors-la-loi et la Garde Royale sera activée en attente.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>

            <li>Portali in tempo di pace: Niente toccate o boop boops salvo durante CoT. Ciò significa nessun attacco ai portali ovunque, a meno che non siano dimostrati ostili. I portali ostili includono attacchi a edifici del clan, membri e tutte le risorse di gioco (incluse le risorse degli eventi stagionali). Attaccare portali nei territori del clan per attività di clan non è consentito a meno che siano ostili.</li>

        <h3>5. TASSE</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Le città con oltre 3 giorni di lingotti accumulati possono essere attaccate da un membro della Guardia Reale dopo un preavviso di 24 ore. I lingotti d'oro non hanno alcun valore personale per te, ma il Re può usarli per attivare bonus per tutto il regno. Se abbiamo i lingotti d'oro, saranno usati a beneficio di K273.</li>
            <li>Numero massimo di lingotti d'oro per città:
                <ul>
                    <li>Città 1-9: 2000 Ingots</li>
                    <li>Città 10-19: 3000 Ingots</li>
                    <li>Città 20-24: 10000 Ingots</li>
                    <li>Città 25-29: 35000 Ingots</li>

            </li>
        </ul>

    <li>
        <h3>6. Membri del Regno Stimato</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Ogni giocatore deve rispettare queste regole per essere protetto dal ROE. I giocatori non protetti sono:
                <ul>
                    <li>FUORILEGGE</li>
                    <li>GIOCATORI SENZA CLAN</li>
                    <li>NON-MEMBRI ROE</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Fuorilegge – Se individui o clan non sono disposti a rispettare il ROE, attaccano edifici del clan o rifiutano di pagare compensazioni per violazioni del ROE riceveranno lo status di fuorilegge. I fuorilegge attuali si trovano in #K273/OUTLAWS. L'elenco attuale dei fuorilegge verrà cancellato e ricomincerà. Questo significa che attualmente non ci sono fuorilegge nel regno. La nuova Guardia Reale condividerà le responsabilità nell'assistenza del regno.</li>
            <li>Guardia Reale: La nuova Guardia Reale è composta da molti clan e ha giocatori molto forti come membri. I doveri della RG continueranno i suoi doveri normali come la riscossione delle tasse e l'applicazione per il Palazzo. I compiti aggiuntivi ora includeranno assistenza ai clan con i fuorilegge e al regno con precisione. Agiranno anche come un esercito d'élite e unità di pattuglia e difesa del regno/territorio.</li>
            <li>In aggiunta attivando relazioni con i grandi clan del regno per assistere quando necessario.</li>
            <li>I giocatori senza clan a 250k di might o meno sono protetti e non devono essere attaccati liberamente.</li>
            <li>I giocatori senza clan con meno di 250k di might attaccati hanno diritto a 2x l'importo della compensazione nelle richieste.</li>
            <li>Le interazioni con questi giocatori dovrebbero prima servire a conoscerli e i loro obiettivi nel gioco. Seguite dall'incoraggiamento a unirsi a un clan. Favorire la crescita nel gioco e giocare per il regno versus ricompensa personale.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones  CoT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Durante, puoi scouteare e attaccare città alle seguenti condizioni:</li>
            <li>Nessun attacco ai forti del clan: Attaccare i forti o gli edifici di un altro clan è severamente proibito.</li>
            <li>Gestione dei portali: Non si applica alcuna restrizione di might. Qualsiasi portale dimostrato ostile ai territori del clan può essere attaccato con rapida giustizia dal clan attaccato. Le marce di clan sono pienamente consentite per chiudere portali ostili. Durante il normale tempo di pace, i portali non possono essere attaccati in alcun momento a meno che non siano dimostrati ostili.</li>
            <li>Gestione delle risorse: Mantieni le risorse basse durante l'evento per evitare furti; invia truppe ai forti se necessario. Pratica No Value City (NVC)</li>
            <li>"Fair Play": Attaccare qualcuno significativamente più debole (ad esempio, sotto la metà del tuo might) è spesso considerato cattivo sport e non è consentito. L'unica istanza in cui è consentito è per un portale ostile. I portali lasciati aperti da giocatori che hanno altri membri che attaccano attraverso di essi sono ancora responsabili per aver lasciato il portale aperto e possono essere attaccati indipendentemente dal loro might. Un rapporto di attacco deve essere fornito in tutte le richieste fatte. Sotto la metà del tuo might non è consentito. La regola del 50% si applica.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>8. Processo di risoluzione dei conflitti</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Quando il ROE viene violato, devono essere seguiti i seguenti passaggi:
                <ol>
                    <li>Contatta l'altro giocatore per tentare di risolvere. Se non c'è risoluzione entro 24 ore, eleva al tuo diplomatico di clan.</li>
                    <li>Se non si raggiunge una risoluzione tra diplomatici di clan, possono portare la questione davanti alla Corte pubblicandola in #K273/CLAIMS. Solo i leader di clan o i diplomatici possono pubblicare richieste in questa chat.</li>
                    <li>I giudici giudicheranno per definire la parte colpevole (se presente) e un importo di compensazione accettabile.</li>
                    <li>Se la parte colpevole (o il suo clan) rifiuta di compensare, la Corte Reale determinerà se il giocatore o il clan deve essere dichiarato fuorilegge e la Guardia Reale sarà attivata in stand-by.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>

<p class="roe-intro">Por ordem do Rei Arihelm, o seguinte ROE está em vigor para o reino:</p>
<ol class="roe-list">
    <li>
        <h3>1. TEMPO DE PAZ</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Ataques a cidades são proibidos exceto durante CoT e trocas de CP planejadas.</li>
            <li><del>Ataques a portais e edifícios de clã são proibidos. A menos que o portal seja comprovadamente hostil ao clã e ou aos seus recursos no território.</del></li>
            <li>Portais em tempo de paz: Nada de tocar ou boop boops salvo no CoT. Isso significa nenhum ataque a portais em nenhum lugar, a menos que sejam comprovadamente hostis. Portais hostis incluem ataques a edifícios do clã, membros e todos os recursos do jogo (incluindo recursos de eventos sazonais). Atacar portais em territórios de clã para atividades do clã não é permitido, a menos que sejam hostis.</li>
            <li>Regras de portais no CoT: Sem restrições.</li>
            <li>Scouting é uma forma de agressão.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>2. DIPLOMATAS</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Os clãs devem identificar pelo menos um diplomata na descrição do clã que possa ajudar na resolução de disputas. Diplomatas devem ser um líder ativo ou superior.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>3. Regras gerais</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Todos os edifícios de recursos dentro do território do clã pertencem a esse clã.</li>
            <li>Incluindo WS e DMs.</li>
            <li>Recursos criados por jogadores pertencem ao indivíduo que os criou, a menos que acordado para compartilhar entre duas partes.</li>
            <li>Criptas raras pertencem ao indivíduo que as desbloqueou.</li>
            <li>WS e DMs:
                <ul>
                    <li>a. Não há mais um sistema de registro.</li>
                    <li>b. Todos os edifícios de recursos selvagens (incluindo DM/WS) são por ordem de chegada (FCFS).</li>
                    <li>c. Reivindicações não podem ser feitas se você for scoutado/atacado em recursos selvagens a menos que:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Você perca o edifício.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>d. É sua responsabilidade enviar mensagem ao seu diplomata, ao outro jogador e ao diplomata/líder de clã deles se alguém estiver scouteando ou atacando você em uma mina.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

        <h3>4. GUIA DE COMPENSAÇÃO DO PALÁCIO --</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Cada ataque ou scouting tem um custo base de 1 milhão de prata. Quaisquer perdas adicionais, danos ou recursos roubados são adicionados a esse custo base.</li>
            <li>RSS: valor igual ao valor roubado</li>
            <li>Ouro: 1 Ouro = 3,000 Prata ou minas de ouro iguais ao roubado + 10% (por decisão da vítima)</li>
            <li>Tar: 1 Tar = 1,000 Prata</li>
            <li>Barras de ouro = sem compensação</li>
            <li>Portal fechado ilegalmente: 1M prata (+1M pelo ataque ilegal em si)</li>
            <li>O dano é calculado de acordo com a seguinte fórmula: As perdas de tropas são calculadas de acordo com a seguinte fórmula:
                <ul>
                    <li>Herói= 1.5k</li>
                    <li>Capitão= 1k</li>

                    <li>Catapultas, Muralhas Nível das muralhas x 200</li>
                    <li>Monstros III-VII (Nível do monstro ⁃ 2) x1.3k</li>
                    <li>Monstros I & II=x 8.64k</li>
                    <li>Guarda mercenária Nível das tropas x120</li>

                    <li>Scouting = 5 milhões de prata</li>
                    <li>Atacar sem destruir = 10 milhões de prata</li>
                    <li>Atacar e destruir = 20 milhões de cada Prata, Iron, Wood, Stone</li>
                </ul>

    <li>
        <h3>5. TAXAS</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Cidades com mais de 3 dias de ingots acumulados podem ser atacadas por um membro da Guarda Real após receber 24 horas de aviso. Lingotes de ouro não têm valor para você pessoalmente, mas o Rei pode usá-los para ativar bônus para todo o reino. Se tivermos barras de ouro, eles serão usados para o benefício de K273.</li>
            <li>Máximo de lingotes de ouro por cidade:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cidade 1-9: 2000 Ingots</li>
                    <li>Cidade 10-19: 3000 Ingots</li>
                    <li>Cidade 20-24: 10000 Ingots</li>
                    <li>Cidade 25-29: 35000 Ingots</li>
                    <li>Cidade 30-34: 60000 Ingots</li>
                    <li>Cidade 35-39: 70000 Ingots</li>
                    <li>Cidade 40+: 90000 Ingots</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>6. Membros do Reino Estimado</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Todo jogador deve cumprir essas regras para ser protegido pelo ROE. Jogadores não protegidos são:
                <ul>
                    <li>FORAS DA LEI</li>
                    <li>JOGADORES SEM CLÃ</li>
                    <li>NÃO-MEMBROS DO ROE</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Fora da lei – Se indivíduos ou clãs não estiverem dispostos a cumprir o ROE, atacarem edifícios de clã ou se recusarem a pagar compensação por violações do ROE, receberão status de fora da lei. Os atuais foras da lei podem ser encontrados em #K273/OUTLAWS. A lista atual de foras da lei será limpa e reiniciada. Isso significa que atualmente não há foras da lei no reino. A nova Guarda Real compartilhará responsabilidades na assistência ao reino.</li>
            <li>Guarda Real: A nova Guarda Real é composta por muitos clãs e possui jogadores muito fortes como membros. Os deveres da RG continuarão suas tarefas normais como coleta de impostos e fiscalização para o Palácio. Tarefas adicionais agora incluirão assistência aos clãs com foras da lei e ao reino com precisão. Eles também atuarão como um exército de elite e unidade de patrulha e defesa do reino/território.</li>
            <li>Além de ativar relações com os grandes clãs do reino para ajudar conforme necessário.</li>
            <li>Jogadores sem clã com 250k de might ou menos estão protegidos e não podem ser atacados livremente.</li>
            <li>Jogadores sem clã com menos de 250k de might atacados têm direito a 2x o valor de compensação nas reivindicações.</li>
            <li>Interações com esses jogadores devem primeiro ser para conhecê-los e seus objetivos no jogo. Em seguida, incentivo para entrar em um clã. Fomentar o crescimento no jogo e jogar pelo reino versus recompensa pessoal.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones  CoT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Durante, você pode scoutear e atacar cidades sob as seguintes condições:</li>
            <li>Sem ataques a fortes de clã: Atacar os fortes ou edifícios de outro clã é estritamente proibido.</li>
            <li>Gestão de Portais: Não há restrição de might. Qualquer portal comprovadamente hostil aos territórios do clã pode ser atacado com justiça rápida pelo clã atacado. Marchas de clã são totalmente permitidas para fechar portais hostis. Durante a paz normal, portais não podem ser atacados em nenhum momento a menos que sejam comprovadamente hostis.</li>
            <li>Gestão de Recursos: Mantenha recursos baixos durante o evento para evitar roubo; envie tropas para fortes se necessário. Pratique No Value City (NVC)</li>
            <li>"Fair Play": Atacar alguém significativamente mais fraco (por exemplo, abaixo da metade da sua might) é frequentemente considerado falta de esportividade e não é permitido. A única instância em que é permitido é para um portal hostil. Portais deixados abertos por jogadores que têm outros membros atacando através deles ainda estão em falta por deixar o portal aberto e podem ser atacados independentemente da sua might. Um relatório de ataque deve ser fornecido em todas as reivindicações feitas. Abaixo da metade da sua might não é permitido. A regra de 50% se aplica.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>8. Processo de resolução de conflitos</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Quando o ROE é violado, os seguintes passos devem ser seguidos:
                <ol>
                    <li>Entre em contato com o outro jogador para tentar resolver. Se não houver resolução em 24 horas, eleve para o seu diplomata de clã.</li>
                    <li>Se nenhuma resolução for alcançada entre diplomatas de clã, eles podem levar a questão à Corte postando em #K273/CLAIMS. Somente líderes de clã ou diplomatas podem postar reivindicações neste chat.</li>
                    <li>Os juízes irão adjudicar para definir a parte culpada (se houver) e um valor aceitável de compensação.</li>
                    <li>Se a parte culpada (ou seu clã) se recusar a compensar, a Corte Real determinará se o jogador ou clã deve ser declarado fora da lei e a Guarda Real será ativada em prontidão.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

            <li>Portale w czasie pokoju: Żadnego dotykania ani boop boops poza CoT. Oznacza to brak ataków na portale gdziekolwiek, chyba że są udowodnione jako wrogie. Wrogie portale obejmują ataki na budynki klanu, członków oraz wszystkie zasoby gry (w tym zasoby wydarzeń sezonowych). Atakowanie portali na terytorium klanu w ramach aktywności klanowych jest niedozwolone, chyba że są wrogie.</li>
            <li>Zasady portali w CoT: Brak ograniczeń.</li>
            <li>Scouting jest formą agresji.</li>

        <h3>2. DYPLOMACI</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Klany muszą wskazać co najmniej jednego dyplomatę w opisie klanu, który może pomóc w rozwiązywaniu sporów. Dyplomaci muszą być aktywnym liderem lub przełożonym.</li>

        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Każdy atak lub scouting wiąże się z bazowym kosztem 1 miliona srebro. Wszelkie dodatkowe straty, szkody lub skradzione zasoby są dodawane do tego kosztu bazowego.</li>

        <h3>5. PODATKI</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Miasta z ponad 3 dniami zgromadzonych ingotów mogą zostać zaatakowane przez członka Gwardii Królewskiej po 24 godzinach ostrzeżenia. Sztabki złota nie mają dla ciebie osobistej wartości, ale Król może ich użyć do włączenia bonusów dla całego królestwa. Jeśli mamy sztabki złota, zostaną użyte dla dobra K273.</li>
            <li>Maksymalna liczba sztabki złota na miasto:
                <ul>
                    <li>Miasto 1-9: 2000 Ingots</li>
                    <li>Miasto 10-19: 3000 Ingots</li>
                    <li>Miasto 20-24: 10000 Ingots</li>

        <h3>6. Członkowie Szacownego Królestwa</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Każdy gracz musi przestrzegać tych zasad, aby być chronionym przez ROE. Gracze niechronieni to:
                <ul>
                    <li>WYJĘCI SPOD PRAWA</li>
                    <li>GRACZE BEZ KLANU</li>
                    <li>NIENALĘŻĄCY DO ROE</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Wyjęci spod prawa – Jeśli osoby lub klany nie chcą przestrzegać ROE, atakują budynki klanowe lub odmawiają zapłaty rekompensaty za naruszenia ROE, otrzymają status wyjętego spod prawa. Aktualnych wyjętych spod prawa można znaleźć w #K273/OUTLAWS. Aktualna lista wyjętych spod prawa zostanie wyczyszczona i rozpoczęta od nowa. Oznacza to, że obecnie nie ma wyjętych spod prawa w królestwie. Nowa Gwardia Królewska będzie współdzielić odpowiedzialności za pomoc w królestwie.</li>
            <li>Gwardia Królewska: Nowa Gwardia Królewska składa się z wielu klanów i ma bardzo silnych graczy jako członków. Obowiązki RG będą kontynuować normalne zadania, takie jak pobór podatków i egzekwowanie dla Pałacu. Dodatkowe obowiązki będą teraz obejmować pomoc klanom z wyjętymi spod prawa i królestwu z precyzją. Będą także działać jako elitarna armia i jednostka patrolowo-obronna królestwa/terytorium.</li>
            <li>Dodatkowo aktywując relacje z większymi klanami królestwa, aby pomóc w razie potrzeby.</li>
            <li>Gracze bez klanu z might 250k lub mniej są chronieni i nie mogą być swobodnie atakowani.</li>
            <li>Gracze bez klanu z mniej niż 250k might zaatakowani mogą dochodzić 2x kwoty rekompensaty w roszczeniach.</li>
            <li>Interakcje z tymi graczami powinny najpierw służyć poznaniu ich i ich celów w grze. Następnie zachęta do dołączenia do klanu. Wspierać rozwój w grze i grać dla królestwa zamiast dla osobistej nagrody.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones  CoT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Podczas, możesz scoutować i atakować miasta na następujących warunkach:</li>
            <li>Brak ataków na forty klanowe: Atakowanie fortów lub budynków innego klanu jest surowo zabronione.</li>
            <li>Zarządzanie portalami: Nie obowiązuje ograniczenie might. Każdy portal udowodniony jako wrogi terytoriom klanu może zostać zaatakowany z szybką sprawiedliwością przez atakowany klan. Marsze klanowe są w pełni dozwolone do zamykania wrogich portali. W normalnym czasie pokoju portale nie mogą być atakowane w żadnym momencie, chyba że są udowodnione jako wrogie.</li>
            <li>Zarządzanie zasobami: Utrzymuj zasoby niskie podczas wydarzenia, aby uniknąć kradzieży; w razie potrzeby wysyłaj wojska do fortów. Praktykuj No Value City (NVC)</li>
            <li>"Fair Play": Atakowanie kogoś znacznie słabszego (np. poniżej połowy twojego might) jest często uznawane za złą sportową postawę i nie jest dozwolone. Jedyny przypadek, w którym jest dozwolone, to wrogi portal. Portale pozostawione otwarte przez graczy, którzy mają innych członków atakujących przez nie, nadal są winni pozostawienia portalu otwartego i mogą być atakowani niezależnie od ich might. Raport z ataku musi być dostarczony we wszystkich roszczeniach. Poniżej połowy twojego might nie jest dozwolone. Obowiązuje zasada 50%.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>8. Proces rozwiązywania konfliktów</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Gdy ROE zostanie naruszone, należy podjąć następujące kroki:
                <ol>
                    <li>Skontaktuj się z drugim graczem, aby spróbować rozwiązać. Jeśli brak rozwiązania w ciągu 24 godzin, eskaluj do swojego dyplomaty klanowego.</li>
                    <li>Jeśli nie osiągnięto rozwiązania między dyplomatami klanowymi, mogą wnieść sprawę przed Sąd publikując ją w #K273/CLAIMS. Tylko liderzy klanu lub dyplomaci mogą publikować roszczenia w tym czacie.</li>
                    <li>Sędziowie rozstrzygną, aby określić winnego (jeśli taki istnieje) i akceptowalną kwotę rekompensaty.</li>
                    <li>Jeśli winna strona (lub jej klan) odmówi rekompensaty, Królewski Sąd zdecyduje, czy gracz lub klan powinien zostać uznany za wyjętego spod prawa, a Gwardia Królewska zostanie aktywowana w gotowości.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

<ol class="roe-list">
    <li>
        <h3>1. МИРНОЕ ВРЕМЯ</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Атаки на города запрещены, кроме CoT и запланированных обменов CP.</li>
            <li><del>Атаки на порталы и клановые здания запрещены. Если только портал не доказан как враждебный клану и или его ресурсам на его территории.</del></li>
            <li>Порталы в мирное время: Не трогать и никаких boop boops, кроме CoT. Это означает никаких атак на порталы нигде, если только они не доказаны как враждебные. Враждебные порталы включают атаки на здания клана, членов и все игровые ресурсы (включая ресурсы сезонных событий). Атаковать порталы на территориях клана для клановой активности нельзя, если только они не враждебные.</li>
            <li>Правила порталов в CoT: Без ограничений.</li>

        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Кланы должны указать хотя бы одного дипломата в описании клана, который может помочь в разрешении споров. Дипломаты должны быть активным лидером или старшим.</li>

        <ul class="roe-points">

        <h3>6. Члены Почитаемого Королевства</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Каждый игрок должен соблюдать эти правила, чтобы быть защищенным ROE. Игроки, не защищенные:
                <ul>
                    <li>ВНЕ ЗАКОНА</li>
                    <li>ИГРОКИ БЕЗ КЛАНА</li>
                    <li>НЕ-УЧАСТНИКИ ROE</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Вне закона – Если отдельные лица или кланы не готовы соблюдать ROE, атакуют клановые здания или отказываются платить компенсацию за нарушения ROE, они получают статус вне закона. Текущих вне закона можно найти в #K273/OUTLAWS. Текущий список вне закона будет очищен и начат заново. Это означает, что сейчас в королевстве нет вне закона. Новая Королевская Гвардия разделит обязанности по помощи королевству.</li>
            <li>Королевская Гвардия: Новая Королевская Гвардия состоит из многих кланов и имеет очень сильных игроков в составе. Обязанности RG продолжат свои обычные обязанности, такие как сбор налогов и обеспечение порядка для Дворца. Дополнительные обязанности теперь будут включать помощь кланам с вне законами и королевству с точностью. Они также будут действовать как элитная армия и патрульно-оборонное подразделение королевства/территории.</li>
            <li>Кроме того, активируя отношения с большими кланами королевства, чтобы помогать при необходимости.</li>
            <li>Игроки без клана с might 250k или ниже защищены и не должны свободно атаковаться.</li>
            <li>Игроки без клана с менее чем 250k might, подвергшиеся атаке, могут требовать 2x компенсации в претензиях.</li>
            <li>Взаимодействия с этими игроками должны сначала быть направлены на знакомство с ними и их целями в игре. Затем — поощрение вступить в клан. Способствовать росту в игре и играть за королевство, а не ради личной выгоды.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones  CoT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Во время, вы можете разведывать и атаковать города при следующих условиях:</li>
            <li>Без атак на клановые форты: Атаки на форты или здания другого клана строго запрещены.</li>
            <li>Управление порталами: Ограничение might не применяется. Любой портал, доказано враждебный территориям клана, может быть атакован с быстрой справедливостью атакуемым кланом. Клановые марши полностью разрешены для закрытия враждебных порталов. В обычное мирное время порталы не могут быть атакованы в любое время, если не доказано, что они враждебны.</li>
            <li>Управление ресурсами: Держите ресурсы низкими во время события, чтобы избежать краж; отправляйте войска в форты при необходимости. Практикуйте No Value City (NVC)</li>
            <li>"Fair Play": Атаковать кого-то значительно слабее (например, меньше половины вашей might) часто считается плохой спортивностью и не допускается. Единственный случай, когда это допускается, — враждебный портал. Порталы, оставленные открытыми игроками, через которые атакуют другие участники, все еще виновны в том, что оставили портал открытым, и могут быть атакованы независимо от их might. Отчет об атаке должен быть предоставлен во всех заявленных претензиях. Ниже половины вашей might не допускается. Применяется правило 50%.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>8. Процесс разрешения конфликтов</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Когда ROE нарушен, следует предпринять следующие шаги:
                <ol>
                    <li>Свяжитесь с другим игроком, чтобы попытаться решить. Если нет решения в течение 24 часов, эскалируйте к вашему клановому дипломату.</li>
                    <li>Если решение не достигнуто между клановыми дипломатами, они могут вынести вопрос в Суд, разместив его в #K273/CLAIMS. Только лидеры клана или дипломаты могут публиковать претензии в этом чате.</li>
                    <li>Судьи вынесут решение, чтобы определить виновную сторону (если есть) и приемлемую сумму компенсации.</li>
                    <li>Если виновная сторона (или ее клан) отказывается компенсировать, Королевский Суд определит, следует ли объявить игрока или клан вне закона, и Королевская Гвардия будет активирована в ожидании.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Varje attack eller scouting har en baskostnad på 1 miljon silver. Eventuella ytterligare förluster, skador eller stulna resurser läggs ovanpå denna baskostnad.</li>
            <li>RSS: belopp lika med det stulna beloppet</li>
            <li>Guld: 1 Guld = 3,000 Silver eller guldgruvor lika med stulen + 10% (enligt offrets beslut)</li>
            <li>Tar: 1 Tar = 1,000 Silver</li>
            <li>Guldtackor = ingen kompensation</li>

        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Städer med mer än 3 dagars ackumulerade ingots kan attackeras av en medlem av den Kungliga Gardet efter 24 timmars varning. Guldtackor har inget personligt värde för dig, men Kungen kan använda dem för att aktivera bonusar för hela riket. Om vi har guldtackor kommer de att användas till fördel för K273.</li>
            <li>Maximalt antal guldtackor per stad:
                <ul>
                    <li>Stad 1-9: 2000 Ingots</li>

        <h3>6. Medlemmar av det Ärade Riket</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Varje spelare måste följa dessa regler för att vara skyddad av ROE. Spelare som inte skyddas är:
                <ul>
                    <li>FREDLÖSA</li>
                    <li>KLANSÖSA SPELARE</li>
                    <li>ICKE-ROE MEDLEMMAR</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Fredlösa – Om individer eller klaner inte vill följa ROE, som attackerar klanbyggnader eller vägrar att betala kompensation för ROE-brott, får de fredlös status. Nuvarande fredlösa kan hittas på #K273/OUTLAWS. Den nuvarande listan över fredlösa kommer att rensas och starta om. Det betyder att det för närvarande inte finns några fredlösa i riket. Den nya Kungliga Gardet kommer att dela ansvar i rikets assistans.</li>
            <li>Kungliga Gardet: Den nya Kungliga Gardet består av många klaner och har mycket starka spelare som medlemmar. RG:s uppgifter kommer att fortsätta sina normala uppgifter som skatteuppbörd och genomdrivning för Palatset. Ytterligare uppgifter kommer nu att inkludera hjälp till klaner med fredlösa och riket med precision. De kommer också att agera som en elitarmé och patrull- och försvarsenhet för riket/territorium.</li>
            <li>Utöver att aktivera relationer med rikets större klaner för att hjälpa vid behov.</li>
            <li>Klanslösa spelare med 250k might eller mindre är skyddade och ska inte fritt attackeras.</li>
            <li>Klanslösa spelare under 250k might som blir attackerade får kräva 2x kompensationsbeloppet.</li>
            <li>Interaktioner med dessa spelare bör först handla om att lära känna dem och deras mål i spelet. Därefter uppmuntran att gå med i en klan. Främja tillväxt i spelet och spela för riket snarare än personlig belöning.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

        <h3>7. Clash of Thrones  CoT</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>Under, kan du spana och attackera städer under följande villkor:</li>
            <li>Inga klanfort-attacker: Attacker på en annan klans fort eller byggnader är strikt förbjudna.</li>
            <li>Portalhantering: Ingen might-begränsning gäller. Varje portal som är bevisat fientlig mot klanens territorier kan attackeras med snabb rättvisa av den attackerade klanen. Klanmarscher är helt tillåtna för att stänga fientliga portaler. Under normal fredstid får portaler inte attackeras vid någon tidpunkt om de inte är bevisat fientliga.</li>
            <li>Resurshantering: Håll resurser låga under eventet för att undvika stöld; skicka trupper till fort om det behövs. Praktisera No Value City (NVC)</li>
            <li>"Fair Play": Att attackera någon betydligt svagare (t.ex. under hälften av din might) anses ofta som dålig sportslighet och är inte tillåtet. Den enda instans där det är tillåtet är för en fientlig portal. Portaler som lämnas öppna av spelare som låter andra medlemmar attackera genom dem är fortfarande ansvariga för att lämna portalen öppen och kan attackeras oavsett deras might. En attackrapport måste tillhandahållas i alla krav som görs. Under hälften av din might är inte tillåtet. 50%-regeln gäller.</li>

        <h3>8. Konfliktlösningsprocess</h3>
        <ul class="roe-points">
            <li>När ROE bryts bör följande steg tas:
                <ol>
                    <li>Kontakta den andra spelaren för att försöka lösa. Om ingen lösning inom 24 timmar, eskalera till din klan-diplomat.</li>
                    <li>Om ingen lösning nås mellan klan-diplomater kan de ta ärendet till domstolen genom att posta det i #K273/CLAIMS. Endast klanledare eller diplomater får posta krav i denna chatt.</li>
                    <li>Domarna kommer att avgöra för att definiera den skyldiga parten (om någon) och ett acceptabelt kompensationsbelopp.</li>
                    <li>Om den skyldiga parten (eller deras klan) vägrar att kompensera, kommer den Kungliga Domstolen att avgöra om spelaren eller klanen ska förklaras fredlös och den Kungliga Gardet aktiveras i beredskap.</li>
